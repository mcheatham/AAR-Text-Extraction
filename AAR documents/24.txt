One year later, disaster struck again when Hurricane Matthew ravaged the coastal communities of the State. Hurricane Matthew made landfall near McClellanville, a small fishing community in Charleston County, as a category one hurricane on October 8, 2016. 

Neighborhoods were left in ruins as the storm cut a path of destruction through South Carolina. A large portion of South Carolina was under a State of Emergency for the second time in as many years.

Wind damage from the storm demolished homes across the coastal counties of the State. Entire neighborhoods were underwater over forty miles inland. 833,000 homes were without electricity. 400,000 people evacuated from their homes in advance of the storm. Despite this, four South Carolina residents lost their lives. Hundreds more lost their homes.

As the State of South Carolina continues its recovery efforts, the focus of putting residents back in their homes will be key.

Just as they did when the catastrophic floods struck in 2015, the people of South Carolina have come together to help each other in the wake of the disaster.

Many residents assisted with the needs of the most vulnerable populations, and there has been an outpouring of assistance for the elderly, disabled, or those families in greatest need.

The State, local governments, and volunteer organizations are working around-the-clock to support individuals and families who require basic services and to address conditions of immediate need. State and local government agencies, as well as civic organizations and community leaders will continue to address the fiscal, social, and environmental challenges of this event for years to come.

The Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, Public Law 114-254 (Appropriations Act), was enacted to set aside federal funds for disaster relief. The Appropriations Act provides funds to States or units of general local government for disaster recovery efforts in the affected areas. The federal government appropriated $1.8 billion in Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds to be made available to States that were declared a major disaster by the President of the United States in 2016.

These funds are to be used to satisfy a portion of unmet need that still remains after other assistance, such as funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Small Business Administration (SBA), or private insurance, has been delivered.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) determines how these federal funds will be long-term recovery, restoration of infrastructure, and housing and economic revitalization. 

Based on this assessment, HUD notified the State of South Carolina that it will receive $65,305,000 in disaster recovery funds to assist in recovery from Hurricane Matthew.

NASA imagery captures Hurricane Matthew as it passes over SC     5 | Page The Appropriations Act requires that the State or local government must expend the funds within six years of the signed agreement between HUD and the grantee unless an extension is granted by HUD.

HUD requires that the funds assist the most impacted areas. To accomplish this requirement, at least 80 percent of the efforts will go towards recovery in Marion County since HUD Allocated funds must be used for eligible disaster-related activities as defined by HUD. To ensure that fraud, waste, and misuse of funds does not occur, effective controls must be in place and monitored for compliance.

The South Carolina Department of Commerce has been designated as the responsible entity for administering the CDBG-DR funds allocated to the State. The Department of Commerce unit responsible for this mission is the South Carolina Disaster Recovery Office.

As required by HUD, South Carolina submits this Action Plan to outline its unmet needs, and establish how the State will allocate its funds through its programs.

This includes the proposed use of funds, criteria for eligibility, and how funds will address long-term recovery in the most impacted and distressed areas.

The Unmet Needs Assessment, which evaluates the three core aspects of recovery  housing, infrastructure, and economic development--forms the basis for the decisions outlined in the Method of Distribution.

This Action Plan was developed with the help of many State and local stakeholders as well as the public to target the unmet need that can be addressed by these limited federal funds.

October 18, 2016: Flood waters continued to impact homes in Marion County 10 days after Hurricane Matthew made landfall     6 | Page UNMET NEEDS ASSESSMENT                  7 | Page Section 2: Unmet Needs Background Community Profile:

Summary of Impact and Presidentially Declared Counties Hurricane Matthew (Figure 1) was a triple threat in that it impacted South Carolinians with storm surges of up to 8 feet in some areas, damaging winds in other places (Figure 2), and rainfall (Figure 3) across nearly the whole presidentially declared impact areas.

In some places these three hazards created a compound threat damaging homes and infrastructure.

More than 31,000 residences had a real property FEMA Verified Property Loss and an additional 1,780 homes saw verified losses in personal property as a result of this event.1

While damage from Hurricane Matthew flooding is fairly easy to identify there were many home damaged by the combination of wind and rainfall.

This has complicated the recovery process in that damage can not only be assessed from below, measuring flood damage, but must consider rain damage as well.

Large portions of the State saw high amounts of rainfall with several areas receiving more than 10 inches of rain in a 24 hour period.2

Figure 3 below, created by the South Carolina State Climate Office at the Department of Natural Resources, illustrates the extent and severity of the hurricane event and associated rainfall amounts.

It was inland areas rather than the immediate coastline that saw the largest amounts of rain.

The peak storm tide in Charleston Harbor was 9.29 feet MLLW / ~3.5 feet MHHW at 0648 UTC (248 AM EDT), which is the third highest on record. The greatest storm surge (storm tide minus the astronomical tide) at Charleston was 6.2 feet and did not occur at the same times as the highest storm tides. Surveys and measurements obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey indicate inundation (i.e., water depths above ground) was generally about 1-2 feet in most areas with locally higher amounts up to ~3.75 feet, mainly in Beaufort County, SC. Interestingly, some of the highest inundation occurred farther inland away from the immediate coast on smaller back bays and inland waterways.

Here, minimum, maximum, and mean predicted surges by city indicate that the surge impact from this storm is not evenly distributed.

Finally, wind derived damage was widespread across the area causing power outages affecting farmers and combining with rainfall to produce heavy impacts in many places.

Figure 2 shows peak wind gust across the Matthew impact area.

These winds coupled with rainfall were enough to cause significant damage to homes and businesses.

A detailed accounting of post-storm impacts by counties can be found in the National Weather Service Post Tropical Cyclone Report.

Included here are many references to wind, flooding, rain, and surge damages.3                                                            1

Emrich to identify those areas most impacted and most vulnerable across the State. Disaster Metrics utilized the Social Vulnerability Index to inform the recovery action plan development process by empirically delineating the most socially vulnerable census tracts within each IA designated county.

Residents in these high vulnerability areas generally have a lower ability to adequately prepare for, respond to, and rebound from disasters, environmental impacts, shocks, and stresses.

Utilizing social vulnerability information in concert with FEMA damage data provides a standardized, replicable, and pragmatic process for understanding where scarce resources would be most helpful in driving successful disaster recovery. This procedure resulted in a visualization of loss/vulnerability for the State where places with high population such as Charleston and Myrtle Beach, are characterized by a general decrease in impact due to lower levels of social vulnerability. Conversely, populations residing in the swath from Dillon to Georgetown, although much less heavily populated, are characterized by generally higher levels of social vulnerability. Targeting resources to these most heavily impacted and vulnerable areas will yield the highest benefit because these areas will be much less able to bounce back without outside assistance. While there was damage along the entire coastal area, the damage (according to an extensive analysis of FEMA Verified Loss Data) outside of these areas is more extensive, especially when compounded with an inability to bounce back (social vulnerability).

The SC Disaster Recovery Office obtained from FEMA an address list of Individual Assistance (IA) applicants and identified those applicants with a FEMA verified real property (housing) loss. Using FEMA damage data, each $5,000 or greater loss was pinpointed on a loss were overlaid on social vulnerability information to identify areas that were both heavily impacted and had a lower capacity to absorb such losses (Figure 5).

This geographic overlay, combining areas of highest vulnerability with the areas containing significant numbers of damaged homes, shown in the map below, clearly indicates that the counties in the Eastern part of the State (from Dillon southeast to the coast) not only contain the highest rate of damaged homes but often also have the highest social vulnerability. Targeting support to these areas in the ield the best outcomes for those with the highest need.

The comprehensive analysis of Unmet Needs is discussed in great detail in Section 3, Unmet Needs Assessment.           13 | Page Figure 5: Bivariate Overlay of Damaged Housing Units & Social Vulnerability        14 | Page Section 3: Unmet Needs Assessment Demographic Profile of the Impacted Area Table 2 shows a breakdown of socio-economics and demographics for the Hurricane Matthew impacted counties of South Carolina.

While many community characteristics across the impact area are similar to

State trends and percentages, there are a few specific socio-demographic differences that should be addressed as a more full discussion of unmet needs is created.

Nearly half (42%) of the South Carolina population resides in the impacted area covered in this assessment.

The population in the impacted area differs from the statewide population in several key areas.

First, the Hurricane Matthew impacted area has a much higher percentage of people living in poverty (23.4%) than the State (16.6%).

This poverty is a primary indicator of places that might see greater impacts from disasters because of a general lack of ability to prepare for shocks and stresses.

Additionally, the impact area has higher percentage of residents over the age of 65, a much lower degree of residents with individuals without health insurance and an African American population of 44% compared to the statewide average of 27%.

Furthermore, these areas have lower labor force participation, lower owner occupied housing and median rent values.

This means that when compared to the State as a whole, there is a higher relative concentration of individuals with vulnerabilities that influence how they respond to disaster events and will decrease their speed of recovery.       15 | Page Table 2: Demographic Profile Information -

Objectives for all money spent on projects.

These are: (1) benefiting low-and moderate- income (LMI) persons, (2) aiding in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or (3) meeting a need having particular urgency (urgent need)5 -

Table 3.

Low- to moderate- income households are defined as households that do not exceed 80% of the median income for their area, as determined by HUD. These income categories are grouped into the following classifications:6

Very low income  has an annual income at 30% or below the area median income

Low income  has an annual income at 31% to 50% of the area median income; and

Moderate income  has an annual income at 51% to 80% of the area median income.

For the purpose of CDBG-Disaster Recovery programs,  apply the below terminology consistent with the original language of the Housing Act and reporting designations in the HUD Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting (DRGR) system. 7

These National Objective definitions and corresponding language are set by HUD regulation. 6 -and-

The terms "persons of low and moderate income" and "low- and moderate-income persons" mean families and individuals whose incomes do not exceed 80 percent of the median income of the area involved, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families. The term "persons of low income" means families and individuals whose incomes do not exceed 50 percent of the median income of the area involved, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families. The term "persons of moderate income" means families and individuals whose incomes exceed 50 percent, but do not exceed 80 percent, of the median income of the area involved, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families.  7

HUD Program Income Limits are published annually for use across all HUD funded programs and contain incongruous terminology to the Housing Act.

Terminology published in the annual income limits is applied to other HUD funded formula allocation programs to support individual income group targets within the LMI category: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html        17 | Page Figure 6: Low to Moderate Income by Block Group.

Many of the counties in the impacted area have relatively high rates of low-and-moderate income populations (Figure 6).

Overall, the average LMI rate for counties across the State-impacted area was approximately 41.79%, with some counties such as Allendale (57.04%), Clarendon (46.97%), Dillon (53%), Georgetown (44.33%), Lee (50.5%), Marion (46.96%), and Williamsburg (51.46%) reaching LMI levels well greater than the State average.

Table 4 below, illustrates the average LMI percentage across all block groups in any county and the maximum LMI of any single block group within that county. It becomes clear when looking at the maximum LMI values that every county has at least one area characterized by very low income levels.

When block group populations are examined, additional LMI concentrations within each county become apparent, as illustrated in the map above.

Detailed LMI maps of those counties with heavy impacts are shown in the following figures (Figure 7-Figure 9) below.           18 | Page Table 4: Low to Moderate Income Summary for Matthew Impacted Counties.

These individuals could be children, older adults, pregnant women, from diverse cultures, transportation disadvantaged, homeless, have chronic medical disorders, and/or a pharmacological dependency. They could have disabilities, live in institutions, have limited English proficiency or altogether non-English speaking.8

Specialized resources may include, but are not limited to social services, accommodations, information, transportation, or medications to maintain health.

Regardless of the nature of the need, care must be taken to ensure that all individuals are able to access disaster recovery resources.

According to U.S. Census data, approximately 3% of the population in the impacted counties speaks a language other than English at home and does not understand English well, with Beaufort (5.46%), Berkeley (3.49%), Dorchester (2.42%), Horry (3.61%), and Jasper (7.82) counties having the highest relative percent of the population speaking different languages and not understanding English well.9

Outreach for the Action Plan and for applicant intake will take careful consideration of the language needs of these populations (see the sections on Outreach and Citizen Participation for more information).

While some may lose homes, others affected may be without homes both prior and following an event of such magnitude. In fact, homeless persons may be faced with even more adversity as others become displaced and shelters become more overcrowded. According to a 2015 Point-In-Time report from the South Carolina Coalition for the Homeless (and federally mandated by HUD), on any given night of January 2015 there were 5,354 homeless people in the State of South Carolina. Of these, approximately 35% are considered to be unsheltered.10

The report referenced was funded by the Emergency Services Grant: a HUD program that aims to help homeless families and persons by improving the amount and quality of emergency shelters available, re-housing the homeless, and preventing more individuals and families from encountering homelessness.

Regarding the population served by the State Housing Opportunities for Persons with HIV/AIDS (HOPWA) program.

Clients impacted by Hurricane Matthew continue to receive services through normal operations.11

Emergency Shelters The massive evacuation ordered for coastal South Carolina in the days preceding Matthew emptied the coasts and filled hotels, motels, homes of friends and families, as well as public shelters across the State. 

The State along with various churches, charitable groups, and schools stepped up quickly to help their fellow South Carolinians.

Shelters opened up across the State to provide those in need with a place to stay and to receive necessities and nourishment. The State opened thirty-two shelters on October 5th and ordered a mandatory evacuation of coastal counties.

The South Carolina Department of Social Services placed another sixty shelters on standby mode, prepared to assist evacuees if needed.12

In total, 120 shelters in twenty-eight counties housed an average of 6,500 people per night and a maximum of 8,503 people in any one night (Table 6).                                                              10 (http://www.schomeless.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Final-DRAFT-PIT-Report-2015-statewide.pdf) 11

Enhanced Focus on Vulnerable Populations South Carolina has taken a cutting-edge approach to its disaster recovery process by assessing social vulnerability as part of its recovery strategy.

A social vulnerability index utilizing the most recent census data (2011-15) measures the social vulnerability of all census tracts with population in the PDD4286 area of interest.      30 | Page The index is a comparative metric facilitating examination of differences in social vulnerability across census tracts, the building blocks of counties.

It graphically illustrates the variation in social vulnerability across the Hurricane Matthew impact area, shows where there is uneven capacity for preparedness and response, and helps pinpoint where resources might be used most effectively to reduce the pre-existing vulnerability and encourage recovery.

Utilizing social vulnerability is also useful as an indicator in determining the differential recovery from disasters.

The social vulnerability index synthesizes socioeconomic variables, which the research literature suggests

An outline of the variables influential in vulnerability for Hurricane Matthew Individual Assistance declared counties is shown in Table 7.

Table 7: Social Vulnerability for Hurricane Matthew IA Counties Notes:

Component scores and composite social vulnerability scores in the accompanying shapefile are relative and comparable across the State of South Carolina.

The cardinalities of components in the accompanying shapefile have been adjusted as indicated above.

The social vulnerability composite score is obtained by summing all component scores. Input data are derived from the Five-Year American Community Survey, 2011-15.          31 | Page The Social Vulnerability Index has high utility as a decision-support tool for emergency management. 

The social vulnerability index metric turns historical disaster impact measures into actionable information for emergency managers, recovery planners, and decision makers as a whole.

It empirically ond to, and rebound from disaster events. Operationally, social vulnerability assessments are

Geospatial Framework, the set of spatial products delivered automatically by FEMA upon Presidential Disaster Declaration.

We utilize the social vulnerability index here for one main reason, namely its past success at providing actionable and useful information to decision makers.

Social vulnerability data was instrumental in targeting resources to those who were in most need during recovery and rebuilding operations in South Carolina following the catastrophic severe storm of 2015.

The October 2015 storm in South Carolina was the first implementation of a methodology to understand pre-event social conditions across the impact area in a post-event recovery context. 

Social vulnerability was utilized by the South Carolina Disaster Recovery Office to identify target areas across the states that would require outside assistance to rebound from this disaster. Here, social vulnerability scores were coupled with FEMA, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and SBA support to rapidly highlight areas with greatest need for additional recovery resources and more importantly to determine unmet needs. 

Utilizing empirically based measures of community social vulnerability disaster recovery dollars and rebuilding resources for the most benefit to the places that were worst impacted and least able to bounce back on their own from this disaster.

Social vulnerability information also provided an academic tool to graphically illustrate and assist VOADs in prioritizing their recovery efforts.

In other words, South Carolina expedited recovery by using data-driven assessment tools to guide actionable, expedited impact to the most vulnerable populations.

Civic Engagement Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters (VOAD), philanthropic organizations, and faith based organizations are often the first line of defense when it comes to community recovery.

Following the devastating flooding in early October of 2015, the citizens of South Carolina pulled together to embark on the recovery process.

Instead of waiting for government assistance, volunteers led the charge to assist individuals and communities with recovery efforts. 

Hurricane Matthew recovery has been no different.

Volunteer Organizations Active in Disaster (VOADs), many still onsite and working to help rebuilding efforts from the 2015 floods, ramped up operations for Hurricane Matthew relief.

Even today, the South Carolina VOAD community continues to coordinate relief efforts across 18 organizations, multiple State agencies and federal government officials as available.13                                                             13 http://scemd.org/recovery-section/donations-and-volunteers     32 | Page To assist these organizations, the One SC Fund, established by the Central Carolina Community Foundation and endorsed by Governor Nikki Haley, continues to support recovery across the State. 

The Central Carolina Community Foundation began the fund with an initial amount of $50,000 and has continued to raise funds from various donors from across the State of South Carolina and the country. This fund aims to help fill the gaps that the government has not yet addressed.

The Foundation supports various federally recognized VOAD non-profit organizations providing relief and recovery to impacted areas, and gives individuals the opportunity to support those in need through private donations.

Non-profit organizations assisting in the relief and recovery efforts may apply for grants to help fund their recovery efforts. As of the latest update, the Central Carolina Community Foundation has given awards to 8 organizations focused on rebuilding home across thirteen counties.

They have repaired one hundred forty-seven homes across thirteen counties (Table 8).14

Personal communication 3/3/2017 with Erin Johnson, Vice President for Community Investment, Central Carolina Community Foundation     33 | Page Summary of Impact and Unmet Needs

The Unmet Needs Assessment must evaluate the three core aspects of recovery  housing, infrastructure, and economic development.

It must approximate unmet need by estimating the portion of need likely to be addressed by insurance proceeds, other federal assistance, or any other funding source by using the most recent available data.

The preliminary estimated impact from Hurricane Matthew in South Carolina is $974,256,948 across the housing, economy, and infrastructure sectors combined.

The figures provided in this assessment are based on best available data at this time and may be adjusted in the future as additional data becomes available.

After taking into account the funds already made available through insurance, State and other federal assistance and other funds, the remaining overall unmet need is approximately $508,145,957 million.

The federal allocation of $65.3 million will allow the State to address less than 13% of the overall unmet need.

When examining the relative need by sector (Figure 14), housing represents the greatest need with $436,116,988 (85.8% of total) in unmet need, followed by the infrastructure sector with $38,763,717 (7.63%) of total in unmet need, followed by the economic sector (including agriculture) with 33,265,252 (6.55% of total) in unmet need. 

Each of these three sectors will be addressed in detail in the sections to follow.

Rental Housing Rental housing is an important component of affordable housing for impacted area.

Much of the rental housing (approximately 84%) in South Carolina was built prior to 1999.17

The older building code and in some cases, the lack of regular maintenance adds to the vacancy rate and therefore the rental housing needs.

The rental vacancy rate for South Carolina in January 2015 was 9.6%, according to the Census.

The median rent for the State is $873 monthly.

Of the FEMA applicants to the IA program for the State-assessed area, more than 16,201 live in rental housing; 14,328 of whom are also of low-and-moderate income.

As indicated by the map below (Figure 17), rental units in the non-urban counties are primarily single family and mobile home units, with the majority of renters in those unit types as opposed to multi-family complexes.

This is due to the rural nature of the communities.                                                             17

SCI WAY SC Housing Statistics Website      39 | Page Figure 17: Rental housing unit breakdown by county and tenure.

Mobile Homes Mobile homes (Figure 18) are part of the housing fabric of South Carolina. 

Their affordability and ease of general maintenance provides housing independence and housing choice to residents across the State.

However, wind, rain, and flooding damage to mobile homes is often difficult to repair, due to the integrated nature of the building components.

In addition, when considering whether or not a structure is repairable, the cost of making those repairs may be disproportionately high when considering the overall value of the structure.

Often, the full extent of mobile home damage is not always realized in the early months after an event and can go unreported in the initial damage inspection.

Damage such as water saturation of the particle board material that makes up the floor framing and decking can cause unsafe deterioration over time. 

Limited assistance funds portioned out through fragmented assistance programs can lead to piecemeal to a decent, safe and sanitary standard.

Of the FEMA IA applicants in the State-assessed areas, approximately 16,137 of them reside in mobile home units.      40 | Page Figure 18: Mobile home percentages by census tract.       41 | Page Damage to mobile homes was concentrated in certain areas, as illustrated in Figure 18. These areas include six counties containing more than 800 mobile homes each with FEMA verified real property loss.

Mobile homes damaged in Beaufort, Dillon, Florence, Horry, Marion, and Williamsburg combine to account for more than 57% of the total mobile homes damaged across the State.

Across the State there were 9,978 mobile homes with a FEMA Real Property Verified Losses (Table 13).

Of these residents, there are subsets of populations over the age of 65, and additionally, who are over 65 and have access and functional needs (AFN).

These applicants, and those who are low-income, often have the fewest means of assistance available to them.

Personal communication with US Department of Housing & Urban Development, Columbia Public Housing Program Center      45 | Page Fair Housing The State's Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing, conducted in 2011, was conducted in conjunction with the 2011-2015 Consolidated Plan and will be refreshed in accordance with the new Consolidated Plan being submitted this year.

The State, including multiple stakeholders such as the SC Human Affairs Commission (HAC), the SC Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA), and the SC State Housing Finance Development Authority (SHFDA), has conducted Fair Housing Surveys on a regular and ongoing basis, and has also undertaken public awareness activities, such as fair housing fairs and roundtable discussions.

The Stateefforts related to HUD funding have been detailed each year in the StatePerformance and Evaluation Report, as required by HUD.

The State's 2011-2015 Consolidated Plan notes that: "The most important impediment [to fair housing] revolves around the lack of Federal and State resources for affordable housing initiatives.... Homeownership programs not only provide loans and grants to prospective buyers, but provide developers with tax credits and other means to reduce costs and make units more affordable. These programs, too, are under constant scrutiny and possible reduction. It should also be noted that the supply of affordable housing units will diminish as they deteriorate or transition out of the affordable housing program, if new units are not created."

Addressing the housing needs of the impacted residents is a priority to ensure housing stock is maintained and housing quality is improved.

This will in turn create the foundation for livable, resilient communities.

The State of South Carolina has created this Unmet Needs Assessment and Action Plan to address a general program design that targets assistance funding to citizens with the most recovery need as determined by geographic concentration of damage, financial impact, and social vulnerability indicators. 

These criteria cover a broad spectrum of characteristics, none of which will be considered in isolation. The State will remain highly agile throughout the planning and implementation process to ensure program design is consistent with need as identified through public engagement.

South Carolina has conducted comprehensive resilience planning that considers regional drivers of short-and long-term resilience and fair housing practices to the smallest possible geographic level. The State will execute resilience planning methods that incorporate data analyzed via social vulnerability as well as public involvement and social justice processes. Resilience planning will incorporate measures to strategically align resources in a way that emboldens drivers of resilience, especially those that provide        46 | Page Housing Funds Made Available The main federal funding sources that are available for impacted residents in the immediate aftermath of a disaster are FEMA Individual Assistance, low-interest loans from the U.S. Small Business Association (SBA), and insurance proceeds from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).

These three funding streams account for the majority of the housing recovery funds made available before CDBG-DR.

Of the twenty counties declared eligible to receive Individual Assistance funding through FEMA in the Hurricane Matthew area of interest, there were 46,686

Applicants.

Of these, 20,400 had a FEMA Property Loss (FVL) assessment; however, this does not mean that the applicant actually received funding.

Of the applicants with a FVL, 7,443 received housing assistance (HA).

An estimated $40,482,388 in damage was assessed for the 20,400 applicants with an

FVL.

This has resulted in $28,439,047 in housing assistance to date (Table 16).

FEMA Individual Assistance (IA)

The FEMA Individual Assistance program (IA) consists of a multitude of services for individuals in disaster declared counties.

Specifically, housing funds are for bridging the gap from sheltering to the return to permanent housing.

These funds can be used for limited basic home repairs and replacement of essential household items as well as rental payments for temporary housing.

Importantly, FEMA IA is limited to

National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Coverage Major flooding disasters are rare events for South Carolina and Hurricane Matthew was unique in that the State saw storm surges, wind, and rain followed by flooding in the eastern portion of the State as flood waters made their way from eastern North Carolina to the coast through Marlboro, Dillion, Horry, Marion, Williamsburg, and Georgetown Counties.

Unfortunately, most of the State lacked any form of flood insurance. In fact only approximately 9% percent of housing units in South Carolina were covered by NFIP policies at the end of 2016.

This may be due in part to properties parents or grandparents) or lien-free because the home no longer has a mortgage associated with it.     47 | Page  he floodplain, or they may choose to forego flood insurance since it is not mandated.

Figure 19, below, indicates an increase in the number of NFIP claims prior to 1999, followed by relatively low usage over the past 15 years.

The number of households with flood insurance has risen from 2% to over 4% through 2014.

Fortunately, flood insurance coverage tends to jump slightly after a major disaster event and South Carolina proved this to be true.

South Carolina had 201,205 flood policies in place (9.1%) at the end of 2016.

Here, because of the flooding in 2015, we see a jump in coverage of more than 5%.

Figure 19: National Flood Insurance Policies by year for South Carolina.

Small Business Administration (SBA) Home Loans The SBA has made $33,662,140 in assistance available to 1,434 homeowner applicants in the Hurricane Matthew impact area.

The low-interest loans are made available for the purposes of home repair and personal property loss.

The average loan for this disaster event was $23,474.

It is important to note that the average SBA loan is nearly $20,000 more than the average FEMA HA payment.

This difference will be discussed more in the Housing Unmet need section.

Housing Trust Fund for the South Carolina Flood Initiative Following the October 2015 flooding in South Carolina, the State acted to create the South Carolina Housing Trust Fund (HTF) Flood Initiative. This State-funded program aims to provide financial support to those most in need of funds to repair and preserve their homes as quickly as possible by utilizing nonprofit, private, and State funding. This initiative helps ensure that homeowners in need can complete necessary repairs and eliminate unhealthy living environments.

The South Carolina Housing Trust Fund (HTF) Flood Initiative Program is a State funded program designed to provide financial assistance in the preservation of safe, decent, sanitary and affordable housing for low-income households within the State of South Carolina that were affected by the October 2015 flood and now Hurricane Matthew.      48 | Page The HTF accelerates the Statefinancing used by the nonprofit and private sectors. It builds partnerships among government, qualified nonprofits and those in need of affordable housing.

It strives to maximize the utilization of federal, State and/or other housing assistance programs in leveraging other public and private resources.

In order to ensure these funds are directed towards those in the most need, eligible parties must be low-income homeowners in declared counties that experienced damages due to the October flooding or Hurricane Matthew. Specifically, these homes in which damages will only worsen without immediate repair are eligible. There is currently a $1 million set-aside in Housing Trust Funds for the SC Flood Initiative.

This funding may be leveraged by the CDBG-DR program, and is currently designed to be accessed by eligible non-profits.

Housing Unmet Needs

In South Carolina, approximately 18,802

FEMA Individual Assistance applicants (40.3%) in the State-assessed area have not been deemed eligible to receive housing assistance to date.

There are a variety of reasons why an applicant may be deemed ineligible for assistance.

According to FEMA, a few of these reasons are:  misspel

If more than one person from the same home address registered, the applications will be flagged until the head of household can be determined.

The applicant has insurance, and more information about the policy is needed.

FEMA cannot duplicate benefits. However, once you receive insurance payment, FEMA may be able to assist with uninsured losses.

Proof of occupancy is required. Whether a homeowner or renter, the damaged dwelling must be a primary residence where the applicant lived at the time of the disaster.

Identity verification is needed. Sometimes an applicant simply needs to submit documentationsuch as a passport or military issued IDso a social security number can be verified. If an applicant was recently married, a marriage certificate or license may be required to verify any 19

Importantly, however, an applicant may be determined to be ineligible because a FEMA damage inspector attributes damage claimed by the applicant as flood/storm-related to have been caused by pre-disaster conditions, or deferred maintenance.

In other words, the inspector may determine that rain damage to the ceiling was due to the applicant having a poorly maintained roof in place before the storm, and not because the storm itself caused the damage.

While there are likely many cases where an applicant is unable to identify uniquely storm-related damage to their home, in many cases, the older homes that lower-income and vulnerable applicants may live in can complicate the rapid inspections conducted by FEMA field officers.                                                            19 http://www.fema.gov/news-release/2013/05/21/ineligible-fema-may-just-need-more-information      49 | Page The insurance-defined differences between flood damage and water damage are technical in nature, and can be misunderstood by residents and damage inspectors alike.

Damage from a flood occurs when water rises on land that is usually dry.

However, water damage occurs when the water strikes the home prior to making contact with the ground.

In many cases, a resident may not have the protection of flood insurance if they rent, live in a home with no mortgage, and/or live in a moderate-to-low -risk flood hazard area.20

Many homeowners as well as renters may not realize that flood damage is not covered by a standard homeowner/rental insurance policy.

Damage inspectors, expecting to see flood damage, may overlook water damage caused by wind-driven rain.

These complications can result in hardship and frustration after a disaster if residents are unable to receive assistance to repair their damaged home.

This issue has been brought to light in previous disasters.

In Texas, fair housing advocates note:  at least 85% of the more than 578,000 applications for housing assistance. The most common denial code used by FEMA (in over 100,000 cases) was -income applicants were told informally by FEMA that their the homes had been in poor condition before the storm and therefore damage could not be attributed to the hurricane. Because low-income households are more likely to have "deferred maintenance," these denials had a disproportionate impact on low-income households, particularly in minority neighborhoods.

Non-profit groups in Houston reported that entire neighborhoods, generally low income and minority concentrated, of damaged homes were

FEMA similarly denied half of all applications for housing assistance following Hurricane Dolly. Based on a suit by Texas homeowners, a Federal District 21

Figure 20 shows the percent of people who applied to FEMA IA who have received an award, by county, as well as the number of applicants receiving funds.

On average, the award rate is approximately 17.99% for the impacted counties.

This number will continue to fluctuate as applicants move through the review pipeline, but it will not go up or down significantly from this low level of support.                                                            20

FEMA IA applicants are of low-to-moderate income (36% -

Under 30% LMI and 9% more under 50% LMI), with 20,224 applicants below 50% of the Area Median Family Income (AMFI) as illustrated in Figure 21.     51 | Page Figure 21: Applicant Summary by Eligibility, Income Category, and County This data indicates that a population of vulnerable individuals may be in need of focused outreach and intake assistance to review their eligibility for the CDBG-DR program, especially in areas where FEMA IA assistance was applied for but not provided.

The map below (Figure 22) shows that while FEMA IA ineligible applicants are disbursed across the State, there are concentrations of ineligible applicants in areas of high social vulnerability.

Areas in Beaufort, Dillon, Horry, and Marion contain higher concentrations of ineligible applicants in high social vulnerability areas while, smaller groups are present in Charleston, Berkeley, Dorchester, and Williamsburg counties.

It should be noted, that the average distance between ineligible and eligible applicants is only ½ mile for 75% of applicants, ¼ mile for 55% and less than 1/10 mile for nearly 30% of applicants.

These results indicate that ineligible recipients saw the same impacts as those found eligible and will likely have a slower recovery because they likely experienced very similar impacts as those felt by FEMA eligible folks.

For this reason, ineligible applicants must be considered in any overall housing unmet need calculation.          52 | Page Figure 22: FEMA IA Ineligible Applicants in Relation to the Social Vulnerability Index         53 | Page Housing Impact Methodology estimated cost to repair those units less repair funds already provided by FEMA.

Because accurate/complete data sources are often difficult to obtain after a major disaster event, HUD has stated that empirically justified calculations may be used to determine the average cost to fully repair a home. using the average real property damage repair costs determined by the Small Business Administration for its disaster loan program for the subset of homes inspected by both SBA and FEMA. Because SBA is inspecting for full repair costs, it is presumed to reflect the full cost to repair the home, which is generally more than the FEMA estimates on the cost to make the home 22

Previously approved impact assessment methodologies have utilized the Small Business Administration estimates of damage and repair needs, FEMA IA Housing Assistance data, and National Flood Insurance data in combination with each other to triangulate the real need as opposed to the FEMA estimated losses.

Utilizing SBA loan values as an indicator of the amount of support any individual household will sive look at recovery than simply looking at a FEMA inspected damage. cost of repairing or replacing a damaged structure to each applicant, returning a more solid estimate of recovery than that coming from FEMA.

Further accounting for under-representation of impacted populations stemming from FEMA ineligible applicants provides a more accurate picture of overall housing impact across a study area.

In South Carolina, when utilizing the average loan amount ($30,209) of all approved applicants (2,216) and applying it to those who were disqualified from SBA and FEMA assistance, the full extent of housing impact caused by Hurricane Matthew is over $700 million (before any deductions for funds already provided are calculated).

In an effort to more finely calibrate the impact amount, the housing impact for this needs assessment was calculated using only SBA data compared with FEMA applicant information.

Here, we utilize the median SBA loan amount of $22,605 to account for outliers in the SBA data (a few very high and very low award amounts) that were impacting the average.

When applied to the universe of FEMA applicants without a FVL, SBA applicants who were not approved, and FEMA data about the number of rentals with damages (1,911) this results in an adjusted housing impact of $498,970,023.

Ten percent in additional resiliency costs were applied, for a total impact of $548,867,025.

After deducting the funds already provided by FEMA, SBA, NFIP, One SC, and the State Housing Trust Fund - $112,750,037, the remaining unmet need for housing is approximately $436,116,988.                                                               22

The immediate recovery efforts were well-documented by the RSS and by the initial project worksheets being submitted for Public Assistance.

Dams The SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) confirmed that twelve dams in eight counties had severe storm damage from Hurricane Matthew.23

Many of these dams were constructed prior to any standards and permitting review and now need to be replaced with structures that will meet modern standards. However, many of the dams were privately owned and may be required to pass stringent threshold requirements for federal assistance.

Roads and Bridges The storm impacted more than 446 roads and 40 bridges causing closures.

As of January 17, State DOT reported only fourteen road closures and 2 bridge closures indicating that most State maintained roads are now functional, however there are still three roads inoperable because of dam failures.

The State is projecting a completion date of winter 2017 for the repair of all roads not associated with dam failure.24

Figure 23: SCDOT Daily Road and Bridge Closures                                                            23 http://www.scdhec.gov/HomeAndEnvironment/DisasterPreparedness/FloodUpdates/MatthewDamStorm Damage/mindex.htm 24 http://info2.scdot.org/StormReports/Storm%20Reports/11AM%20Report-Hurricane%20Matthew.pdf     56 | Page In addition, there are approximately 21,000 paved and unpaved county and municipal roads that are not maintained or tracked by the State or a federal entity.

These roads significantly impact rural communities and need to be assessed for repair.

Local governments will spearhead these assessments in conjunction with emergency management officials as they progress through the Public Assistance process. There is the possibility that some roads impacted by Hurricane Matthew may qualify for assistance through Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).

Water & Wastewater Systems Of the 24 wastewater treatment systems that experienced damage (electrical, roof damage, influent pump stations) there were no lengthy closures.25

Two treatment plants were inoperable for approximately one week.

To enhance existing systems or combine systems would improve efficiency.

Many drinking water systems were impacted when breaks to their distribution systems occurred.

All systems were rapidly restored and remain operational. The State will address hurricane/flood damage actions for some plants through mitigation projects.

Public Assistance The FEMA Public Assistance (FEMA-PA) Program is designed to provide immediate assistance to impacted jurisdictions for emergency protective measures and permanent repairs to infrastructure and community facilities.

The Federal share of assistance is generally not less than 75% of the eligible project cost, requiring the State to contribute the remaining 25% in cost share.

The Public Assistance Program for FEMA 4286 has identified $145,981,445 and $51,930,926 in public assistance for Category A (Debris removal) and Category B (Emergency protective measures) respectively

Additionally, the State has identified $145,230,449 in public assistance need for Categories C-G (permanent repair) to date in the State-assessed counties.

These categories include:

Category C: Roads and Bridges Category D: Water Control Facilities Category E: Buildings and Equipment Category F: Utilities Category G: Parks, Recreational Facilities, and Other Facilities Based on this data, and because applicants must prove how the 25% cost share will be covered before any application is approved, the State should have no unmet need for public assistance projects.

For the sake of understanding the worst case scenario, if the State were to provide this match from CDBG-DR funds, an unprecedented move, the unmet needs related to PA projects would be $36,307,612 for identified infrastructure damage eligible under FEMA-PA Categories C-G.                                                               25

HMGP is generally calculated at 15% of the total amount of IA and PA allocated to a disaster event.

As of February 25, 2017 the amount available for mitigation and resilience activities statewide will likely be between $36M - $42M.26

Then, calculating that

HMGP assistance to any jurisdiction is capped at 75% of the identified need (the remaining 25% being a required local match), it can be assumed that jurisdictions will be required to provide between $9M - $10M in local match, representing an unmet need for resilience improvements.

The HMGP process is in its initial stages at this time, and will be rolled out over the coming months.

Existing Efforts by South Carolina CDBG Non-Entitlement Program The State of South Carolina's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, operated by the South Carolina Department of Commerce, received an annual allocation of $18,871,096 from HUD in 2016.

Over $10.5 million of this was dedicated to community infrastructure activities such as water, sewer, roads, drainage or other activities.

The other program funds (excluding planning and administrative costs) were $3,000,000 for Community Enrichment, $1,270,119 for Neighborhood Revitalization, $300,000 for Special Projects, $600,000 Ready-to-Go, and $ 2,000,000 for Business Development.

After Hurricane Matthew, CDBG program managers reached out to their grantee communities to assess impact caused by the hurricane and to determine need for program response, including activating the provision in the Action Plan that "up to ten percent of the Statereallocated to address the needs of the [declared] disaster" (2016 State Action Plan).

The program did not receive sufficient response to activate the provision, and the 2017 program is expected to operate as planned to meet project needs that were identified before the hurricane.

Economic Impact Business & Employment

According to FEMA reports, subject matter experts, and other news reportsimpacted economic sectors were tourism and agribusiness (cotton and wheat).

Coastal areas suffered a short-term decline in tourism around Matthew but quickly bounced back to health leading to recent reports of growth and increase in jobs.

Although economic losses are relatively small, the storm caused a significant amount of coastal erosion, especially in tourism-driven areas, that resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of sand along the StateAdvocates.

Tourism, especially centered around the golf industry was impacted slightly by Hurricane Matthew as poor weather conditions kept tourists at home.

The percentage of golf course employees in Horry County Myrtle Beach Golf Holiday. One of two yearly peaks happens around the first weekend in October. That means the storm left a full weekend without golfers at a prime rate. Empty tee sheets for one weekend mean a short-term financial hit, but course managers know their business is dependent on the weather.                                                            26

To assist business owners in recovery the SBA opened three Business Recovery Centers to enable storm-impacted businesses to meet individually with SBA officials.

As of March 1, 2017, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has issued $9,841,100 in Business and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) to the State impacted area covered in this assessment.28

Three counties (Beaufort, Horry, and Marion) had more than 100 SBA business loan applications.29

Entities such as small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives, and most private nonprofit organizations in disaster impacted areas may apply for low-interest EIDL loans to assist with operating expenses and working capital.

The Business Physical Disaster Loss loans are available for machinery, equipment, and other real-property damages.

Utilizing SBA business data to understand the financial impact to livelihoods provides a more comprehensive understanding of impacts and recovery across the State.

The small business administration makes low cost disaster loans available to qualified businesses.

According to SBA business loan information, approximately 536 applicants had a verified property loss of $15,591,563 and another 188 applicants either withdrew or were declined for a loan from the program.

The average verified loss for all applicants was $72,183 and the median loss was $25,442.

Utilizing the general methodology put forth for the housing impact and unmet needs enables us to identify the true impact and possible extra estimated impacts for businesses who did not qualify for loans.

Table 21 outlines the impacts, estimated impacts, and support provided by the SBA to business owners across the impacted counties.

Here we capture the total real property loss of $23,031,713 by summing the verified losses of $15.6M, the estimated losses of $4.8M (188 applicants either declined or withdrawn from the program multiplied by the median verified loss of $25,442) and the amount of verified reconstruction loss of $2.7M.

Next we use the same method to sum the verified and estimated losses to furniture, machinery, inventory, and business operating expenses ($11,932,194).

According to this method, total business impacts from

Matthew were $34,963,907.

SBA payouts to businesses totaled $9,841,100 for these lines of loss, leaving a potential unmet need of $25,122,807.                                                                 27 http://www.wmbfnews.com/story/33487039/tracking-the-economic-impact-of-hurricane-matthew 28

Data provided by South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce on 4/20/16     64 | Page Impact to Agribusiness The State has a rich agricultural heritage that has provided South Carolinians with jobs, local food sources, and a viable trade commodity, with public port and transportation facilities in Charleston, North Charleston, Charleston County, Georgetown and Greer to support domestic and international trade. The favorable climate and steady water supply in South Carolina create ideal growing conditions.

Hurricane Matthew caused moderate damage to cotton, wheat, soybeans and a variety of other crops that were damaged by heavy winds. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says cotton farmers make up the Marlboro County workforce at a rate more than 50 times greater than the national average. Hurricane Matthew came at the absolutely worst time for cotton farmers.

Through the use oState-impacted counties (Figure 24). The data covers insured crops for which indemnity was received as a result of cyclone, hurricane, flood, precipitation, excess moisture, tornado, wind, or inability to plant from October 2016 through December of 2016. By coupling the Indemnity data and Coverage Level data from the USDA, a total loss estimate, and corresponding unmet need has been estimated.

From October to December of 2016, approximately $21,276,541 of indemnity was paid out to farmers who suffered losses due to Hurricane Matthew impacts (Table 23). The estimated total loss (Table 24), derived by calculating the estimated additional losses based on coverage level (% of crops not covered) by the indemnity payments from USDA data, (for October through December) was approximately $29,418,986. This brings the estimated unmet need to $8,142,445 (Estimated Total Loss Indemnity Paid) for the three-month period directly following the flooding.33

HUD has provided the State of South Carolina with $65,305,000 in disaster recovery funds to assist in recovery from the Hurricane. 

HUD has further stipulated that 80% of the efforts must address unmet needs of Marion County.

The State partnered with

Disaster Metrics to assess the unmet needs of South Carolina as a result of Hurricane Matthew.      69 | Page Disaster Metrics performed a comprehensive Unmet Needs Assessment, identifying the needs across three sectors: housing, the economy, and infrastructure.

The preliminary estimated impact from Hurricane Matthew in South Carolina is $974,256,948 across the housing, economy, and infrastructure sectors combined.

The figure is based on best available data at this time and may be adjusted in the future as additional data becomes available.

After taking into account the funds already made available through insurance, State, and federal assistance, the remaining overall unmet need is approximately $508,145,957.

The federal allocation of $65.3 million will allow the State to address less than 13% of the overall unmet need.

When examining the relative need by sector, housing represents the greatest need with $436,116,988 (86% of total) in unmet need, followed by the infrastructure sector with $38,763,717 (8% of total) in unmet need, followed by the economy sector (including agriculture) with $33,265,252 (6% of total) in unmet need. 

Each of these three sectors are addressed in greater detail in the full Unmet Needs Assessment available in the appendix of this document.

When comparing these three sectors, it becomes clear where the greatest unmet needs exist. 

The housing unmet need is 11 times greater than the infrastructure need, 13 times greater than the economy sector need, and 6 times greater than the infrastructure and economy sectors combined.

Therefore, the primary focus of the SCDRO will be to address the housing unmet needs with these limited federal dollars.

By analyzing a number of social vulnerability factors, Disaster Metrics was able to empirically identify the most socially vulnerable census tracts within each FEMA Individual Assistance designated county.

Residents in these high vulnerability areas generally have a lower ability to adequately prepare for, respond to, and rebound from environmental impacts (such as hurricanes), shocks, and stresses.      70 | Page Utilizing social vulnerability information combined with FEMA damage data provides a standardized, replicable, and pragmatic process for finding and understanding people and places where scarce resources would be most helpful in driving successful disaster recovery.

The State uses the FEMA verified loss information and social vulnerability analysis as an assessment and targeting tool. 

It allows the State to find the most vulnerable citizens. These are the citizens who are the least likely or able to run away from a disaster. 

They are the citizens who are the least likely to have the ability to recover without help. 

These tools allow the State to focus the recovery efforts. The State will use this information as part of a holistic recovery approach. 

This approach will allow the State to direct the implementation vendor to locations where intake center can have the greatest chance of assisting large populations of impacted citizens.

This geographic overlay, combining areas of highest vulnerability with the areas containing significant numbers of damaged homes36, clearly indicates that most of the counties (with the exception of Charleston) with the most FEMA Verified Losses over $5,000 often also have high social vulnerability scores. 

With the exception of Beaufort (12.4%), and Dorchester (11.8%), all of the declared counties had poverty rates higher than the national level of 15.6%.

Even more significant was the number of counties with poverty rates near or close to double the national percentage. 

Allendale, Chesterfield, Bamberg, Barnwell, Dillon, Marion, Marlboro, and Williamsburg Counties all had percentages over 28% with Allendale registering at 32.5%. 

Targeting support to these areas in the immediate and long-term recovery phases of the disaster will yield the best outcomes for those with the highest need.                                                             36

Normalizing the number of homes damaged by the total number of homes in an area creat effectively creating a targeting capability for use by recovery personnel operating on the ground.     71 | Page Section 5: Method of Distribution CDBG-DR Program National Objectives South Carolina has designed this CDBG-DR program in compliance with the National Program objectives, and will ensure that assistance is prioritized toward the most disadvantaged populations. South Carolina intends to spend a minimum of 90% of program funds on activities that benefit the Low-and-Moderate Income (LMI) population.

LMI status is determined by evaluating income as a percentage of the Area Median Income (AMI) in the region in which the applicant lives.

The State will spend no less than 90% of funds allocated for direct benefit to LMI households.

Furthermore, the State will take necessary steps to ensure that the needs of very low-income households (30% of the AMI or below) and low-income households (30% - 50% AMI) are prioritized, followed by moderate income households (51% to 80% AMI).

As stewards of federal CDBG funds, the State of South Carolina complies with the Department of Housing housing, a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities, principally for LMI persons.

To this end, all funded activities administered by the State of South Carolina will meet one of three named HUD national objectives:   1)

Benefitting LMI Persons;  2)

Preventing or Eliminating Slum or Blight; or  3)

Meeting Urgent Needs.

Assistance will be made to eligible applicants in the impacted area, as funds are available, with priority given to applicants with verified household income at 80% or below the AMI for the region in which they reside. HUD directed the State to spend at least 70% of the funds on LMI households. The State plans on assisting only citizens that are 80% LMI and below.

The State will use an analysis of social vulnerability factors to focus efforts to locate eligible citizens. 

Hurricane Matthew assistance programs will begin by September 2017 and be completed by September 2020.

In addition, the State will further target benefits within these income categories by considering disability and age-dependent status.

Where practicable, vulnerable and special needs populations will be given urgent attention.       72 | Page Program Budget The State will allocate all program dollars for housing recovery activities, except for the $1 million for Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) match. The following is a table of budgeted categories:

Program Amount Allocated Single Family Housing Program $60,039,750

HUD has further stipulated that at least 80% of the efforts must address unmet needs within Marion County.

Leveraging of Funds CDBG-DR funds are a last resort funding source. The State has worked with HUD, FEMA, SBA, other federal agencies and State-funded agencies to identify and catalog available sources of assistance for recovery from Hurricane Matthew. The State will ensure that CDBG-DR funds are only used to address funding needs not satisfied by other funding sources, many of which are already providing disaster relief, including, but not limited to:

FEMA Individual Assistance grants

FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program SBA Disaster Loans National Flood Insurance Program payments

Private insurance

Natural Resources Conservation Service Emergency Watershed programs

Water Conservation District funds

USDA Farm Drinking Water and Water Pollution Control funds, and

Private foundations      73 | Page In accordance with the Robert T. Stafford Act, as amended, the State will implement policies and procedures to ensure no individual receives duplication of benefit for the same purpose and/or effect to recover from Hurricane Matthew. Federal law prohibits any person, business concern, or other entity from receiving Federal funds for any part of such loss for which the person has received financial assistance under any other program, from private insurance, charitable assistance or any other source.

Housing Programs Disaster Recovery funds are divided into three umbrella categories of eligible activity: Housing, Infrastructure and Economic Recovery.

Based on analysis of the Stateamount of recovery funds made available, South Carolina will target the vast majority of recovery funds toward the most evident need in the area of housing recovery.

The impact of the Hurricane

Matthew on the housing sector is estimated at a cost of over half a billion dollars.

Aging housing stock suffered damage on a number of fronts: flood damage from below and structural damage to roofs and foundations from combined substantial rain and wind.

Hundreds of homes were destroyed or severely damaged, leaving families living in substandard or unsafe conditions, or causing them to be displaced from their communities and places of employment. 

Due to the overwhelming unmet housing need, the Disaster Recovery Program will consist entirely of housing program activities at this time, except for $1 million in HMGP match for eligible applicants in Marion County.

To assist the most vulnerable families in their recovery efforts, the State has developed a housing program to meet the housing needs as identified through the unmet needs assessment to include: 1.

Repair/Rehabilitation of existing housing units; 2.

Replacement of damaged Manufactured Housing Units (MHUs) deemed unrepairable through a feasibility review; 3.

Consideration of limited relocation assistance on a case by case basis; and  4.

Inclusion, during the execution of these activities, as needed and appropriate, identification of opportunities for mitigation enhancement measures, improvement of resilience, ancillary improvements such as elevation and access ramps, and assistance to applicants in completing program applications.

South Carolina will implement construction methods that emphasize quality, durability, energy efficiency, sustainability, and mold resistance. All rehabilitation, reconstruction, and new construction will be designed to incorporate principles of sustainability, including water and energy efficiency, resilience, and mitigation against the impact of future disasters.

In South Carolina, all counties and some localities require permits. All counties and the localities with such requirements have standing offices to process the required permits. There are currently no known local capacity issues which would prevent the needed permits from being processed and issued.       74 | Page Where feasible, the State will follow best practices such as those provided by the U.S. Department of Energy's Guidelines for Home Energy Professionals.

For all new construction or for substantially rehabilitated structures, the State will require construction to meet ENERGY STAR certification standards.

For non-substantially rehabilitated structures, the State will follow the HUD CPD Green Building Retrofit Checklist guidelines, and apply them to rehabilitation work undertaken to include the use of mold resistant products when replacing surfaces such as drywall. When older or obsolete products are replaced as part of rehabilitation work, the State will use products and appliances with ENERGY STAR labels, Water Sense labels, or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) designations.

South Carolina will implement and monitor construction results to ensure the safety of residents and the quality of homes assisted through the program. All Single Family, Rental and Mobile Homes repaired must comply with the current HUD Housing Quality Standards (HQS). In addition, SCDRO has coordinated with DHEC to ensure applicants are aware of the risks associated with mold and take steps to limit the impact of any mold issues that may arise.

To prevent duplication of benefits, the State will require that all sources (federal, State, local, private) and amounts of disaster housing assistance received or reasonably anticipated to be received are documented with submission of an application for CDBG-DR funding. Duplication of benefits for housing assistance will only consider other sources of funding pertaining to structural damage caused by the hurricane. 

Assistance for contents and personal items will not be considered duplication.

Prior to program-related construction, applicant awardees must submit any additional funds received for housing damage caused by the presidentially-declared hurricane disaster to the State to avoid duplication of benefits. CDBG-DR funding must be the funding of last resort. Any additional funds paid to applicant awardees for the same purpose as the housing assistance award after the State has completed the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of the ap must be returned to the State of South Carolina.

Providing a home that is safe, sanitary, and secure is the ultimate goal of the State Mobile Home Resilience Due to the difficulty, expense, and long-term ineffectiveness of mobile home repair, SCDRO will perform a repair feasibility analysis and replace damaged mobile homes that cannot reasonably be repaired.

SCDRO will implement resilient practices to ensure the viability, durability and accessibility of replacement mobile homes.

Although some local building codes allow installation of Wind Zone I rated mobile homes, SCDRO will only utilize mobile homes with a minimum wind rating of HUD Wind Zone II or higher (able to withstand winds up to 100 MPH).   grade without appropriate structural reinforcement.      75 | Page Single Family Housing Program Applicants applying for assistance must have suffered documented damage to their housing units as a result of the October 2016 presidentially-declared hurricane disaster. Such documentation may include an inspection report conducted by FEMA, SBA and/or a privately contracted inspector. 

The primary responsibility is on the citizen to prove that damage was caused by

Hurricane Matthew.

In cases of demonstrable hardship or circumstances, the State may consider utilizing the implementation contractor to conduct an inspection to determine if the housing unit was damaged as a result of the October 2016 hurricane disaster.

If the State does not believe the damage was a result of the hurricane disaster, the citizen may be referred to a volunteer organization active in the disaster (VOAD) for assistance and resource coordination.

All applicant homeowners will be held to the following criteria as condition of eligibility:

Applicant must own and have occupied a single-family home or MHU located within the 24 counties for which FEMA Individual Assistance was approved for the October 2016 presidentially declared hurricane disaster area.

The property must have documented damage as a result of the declared disaster.

Applicant must provide evidence of primary residence at the location in which the applicant currently lives or lived at the time of the event and for which they are seeking assistance. 

Households are allowed alternative ways to document proof of primary residency. They can do so by one of the following options: a.

Any one (1) of the following:  i. proof of FEMA IA assistance;  ii.

Federal income tax return showing their permanent home address,  iii. government-issued identification issued prior to and expiring after impacted period; or iv. property tax homestead exemption;  b.

By providing any two (2) of the following:  i. utility bills mailed to the property address;  ii. vehicle registration or renewal at the address in the impacted period; iii.

Proof of government benefits received at least one month prior and one month after the impacted period; iv. property insurance documents indicating the insured property as primary residence; or  c.

A sworn affidavit signed under penalty of perjury.

One person on the application with an ownership interest in part or in whole on the property must be able to demonstrate U.S. Citizenship or Lawful Permanent Residence.

The homeowner must agree to own the home and use the home as their primary residence for a period of 3 years after rehabilitation or mitigation as secured through a forgivable promissory note and lien.

If located in a flood plain, the applicant must acquire flood insurance and comply with obligations to notify future owners of flood-insurance requirements.     76 | Page In order to assist the most vulnerable populations with this disaster recovery funding, South Carolina intends to prioritize assistance for all housing programs based on the following criteria:

Individuals who are in the extremely low and very low income brackets;37

Persons with documented disabilities; Age-dependent household members at the time of disaster or at the end of the application intake period (aged 65 or older, or 5 or below).

Priorities will be addressed as follows:    30% AMI or

BELOW 31% AMI to 50% AMI 51% AMI to 80% AMI Age Dependent & Disabled, or Multiple Disabled Individuals  1st

Priority 3rd

Priority 5th

Priority Either

Age Dependent or Disabled  2nd

Priority 4th

Priority 6th

Priority Age Dependent or Disabled   5th

Priority 7th

Priority 8th

Priority  the available funding, the State will assist all possible eligible applicants with households falling within these priority categories (in other words, under the 80% AMI threshold) before giving any consideration to extending housing assistance to those eligible applicants whose income is above the 80% AMI threshold.  80% of the Hurricane Matthew recovery efforts will be targeted to Marion County. Lower priority applicants in Marion County may be served before higher priority applicants in other counties.

For example, a 5th priority applicant in Marion County may be served before a 1st priority applicant that resides in Beaufort County because a much larger portion of the program activities have to go towards Marion County based on HUD requirements.

Basis for Calculating Housing Assistance Awards If eligible and awarded, housing assistance award calculations are based on the following factors: 1.

Damage/scope of project work needed; 2.

Pre-disaster housing unit value; 3.

A review of funding from all sources to ensure no Duplication of

Benefits (DOB); and 4.

DOB funds, if any, for use in the project.                                                             37

Applicants may review income limits for their household size by reviewing the table of income limits by county, available in the Appendix.     77 | Page Housing assistance awards will be determined after factoring in the inputs listed above, subtracting any unaccounted for DOB, and then factoring in the pre-determined program assistance maximums that apply to the particular housing assistance activities to be used. 

Funds qualified as DOB may be required to be placed in escrow while assistance is provided. 

This process will follow guidance provided by: 21. 

Duplication of Benefits, pages 54  55 of 81 FR 39702 (2016).

If a determination is made during the process that the Assistance Awardee has a duplication of benefits, and the award is still on hand, the Assistance Awardee will be required to sign an escrow agreement with the Implementation Contractor. This agreement will require the Assistance Awardee to transfer all duplication of benefits funds to the SCDRO. The SCDRO will hold those funds until the construction is complete. 

Once construction is satisfactorily completed, the SCDRO will gthe Implementation Contractor.

The State of South Carolina will not provide funds to individual citizens. The purpose of the Stateprogram is to repair or replace housing stock throughout the disaster affected area. To that end, the State will coordinate all construction activity being funding by the State-DR allocation through the StateThe award maximums for each type of housing assistance are listed below:

Single Family Housing unit (stick-built) repair/rehabilitation assistance awards: up to $30,000 in Housing Recovery Services.

Manufactured Housing Unit (MHU) replacement assistance awards  up to $60,000 in Housing Recovery Services; and

Modular Housing Unit replacement/substitution assistance awards  up to $90,000 in Housing Recovery Services; and

Extremely limited temporary relocation assistance (case-by-case basis) for applicants in either single family stick-built or manufactured housing units up to $5,000.

Housing Recovery funds may be combined with in-kind assistance, such as labor and materials provided by VOADs.

The total amount of assistance when considering in-kind and private assistance shall not be limited by the corresponding cap on Housing Recovery funds, as the caps are related to SCDRO program funds only.

In cases of severe demonstrable hardship, the State may consider funding difficult or unexpected repairs above and beyond the maximum awards.

The State will use a Special Case Panel with members appointed by the SCDRO Program Management Director to evaluate and authorize projects that exceed the stated program limits.

Awards may include expenses for additional related costs such as elevation, insurance, ADA modifications or emergency repair of water or sewer connections. 

The State will address the access and functional needs of individual citizens in all phases of the recovery process especially in the intake and housing repair or replacement phases.      78 | Page Consideration will be made for citizens with communication limitations, disabilities, are elderly, or have chronic medical disorders.

Cost effective energy measures and improvements that meet Housing Quality Standards, especially those improvements which add enhanced resilience, such as elevation of major electrical components, roof-strapping, enhanced tie-downs and other items are also eligible.

Lead-based paint abatement, asbestos abatement, or other remediation components shall also be eligible.

A grantee of the State may choose to use pre-disaster value, as provided in the guidance from 81 FR 39702 (2016), as long as the methodology is equitably applied. In addition, the

State of South Carolina will allow any household to appeal its property valuation and provide rationale for why the valuation should be changed, should that household have reason to believe the valuation is incorrectly calculated because of historical inequity and/or other grounds.

VOAD Construction Activities The State of South Carolina will procure an implementation contractor to execute the Stateprograms. In an effort to expedite the delivery of assistance, the implementation contractor will be required to supplement construction activities through the use of Volunteer Organizations Active in the Disaster (VOADs) at every possible opportunity. All VOADs that meet insurance and licensing requirements will be provided with the opportunity to complete housing projects that match their capabilities.

The implementation contractor will provide VOADs with a list of construction-ready projects within the operation area served by the VOAD. The VOAD will have the option to select a project that best matches their capabilities without penalty for declining any projects. All projects that are completed by VOADs are required to meet all the same standards and quality requirements as the projects completed by the implementation contractor.

Construction Warranties and Quality Appeals South Carolina will provide assisted homeowners with a one year warranty on the work performed and funded by the Single Family Housing Program.

Applicants will have access to a quality appeals process to address any construction quality concerns identified by the homeowner during the construction process.

Construction quality appeals will be verified by inspection and decided by SCDRO.

Flood Insurance & Elevation South Carolina will implement resilient home construction standards. South Carolina will follow HUD guidance to ensure all structures, defined at 44 CFR 59.1, designed principally for residential use and located in the 1 percent annual (or 100-year) floodplain that receive assistance for new construction, repair of substantial damage, or substantial improvement, as defined at 24 CFR 55.2(b)(10), must be elevated with the lowest floor, including the basement, at least two feet above the 1 percent annual floodplain elevation. Residential structures with no dwelling units and no residents below two feet above the 1 percent annual floodplain, must be elevated or flood-proofed, in accordance with FEMA flood-proofing standards at 44 CFR 60.3(c)(3)(ii) or successor standard, up to at least two feet above the 1 percent annual floodplain.     79 | Page Property owners assisted through the recovery program will be required to acquire and maintain flood insurance if their properties are located in a FEMA designated floodplain. This requirement is mandated to protect safety of residents and their property and the investment of federal dollars. The elevation height of a house can significantly reduce the cost of flood insurance. South Carolina will implement procedures and mechanisms to ensure that assisted property owners comply with all flood insurance requirements, including the purchase and notification requirements described below, prior to providing assistance.

South Carolina will ensure adherence to Section 582 regarding the responsibility to inform property owners receiving disaster assistance that triggers the flood insurance purchase requirement that they have a statutory responsibility to notify any transferee of the requirement to obtain and maintain flood insurance, and that the transferring owner may be liable if he or she fails to do so.

As a general rule, the State will not provide assistance for flood insurance. In cases of hardship, the State may provide limited, temporary assistance for the provision of flood insurance in order to properly secure the federal investment in the property.

Demonstrable Hardship South Carolina may consider exceptions to program policies for applicants who demonstrate undue hardship.

Applicants in this situation will be reviewed to determine whether denial of program assistance further perpetuates circumstance attributing to such hardship. Demonstrable hardship may include but is not limited to: prolonged job loss, substantial reduction to household income, death of a family member, unexpected and extraordinary medical bills, disability, etc.

Affordable Rental Program The SCDRO will allocate $500,000 in funding for an Affordable Rental Program to repair and restore the availability of affordable rental stock in Marion County. 

The program will provide up to $25,000 in construction services to rental property owners for eligible activities including the rehabilitation and associated improvements, such as energy efficiency and resilience activities, of single-family stick-built rental properties.

Benefit to Low and Moderate Income (LMI) persons is the only National Objective that is approved for the Rental Program.

In order to receive assistance, the property owner must agree to a five-year affordability requirement.

The affordability requirement requires the property owner to lease the units to LMI households earning 80% or less of the AMI and to lease the units at affordable rents.

Rents must comply with the maximum HUD HOME rent limits. The maximum HUD HOME rents are the lesser of38:

The fair market rent for existing housing for comparable units in the area as established by HUD under 24 CFR 888.111; or

A rent that does not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of a family whose annual income equals 65% of the AMI, as determined by HUD, with adjustments for number of bedrooms in the                                                            38

More information on HOME rents may be found at: https://www.hudexchange.info/manage-a-program/home-rent-limits/      80 | Page  unit. The HOME rent limits provided by HUD will include average occupancy per unit and adjusted income assumptions.

The Affordable Rental Program will repair up to two units per rental property owner, with a $25,000 cap each.

SCDRO may consider repairs beyond the $25,000 cap on a case-by-case basis.

Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP)

The State will designate $1 million dollars to match Hazard Mitigation Grant Program activities in Marion County. Any match funding activities must meet CDBG-DR and HMGP eligibility requirements. Activities may include but are not limited to: structural elevation, localized flood risk reduction, infrastructure retrofit, and post-disaster code enforcement.

Applicants are required to submit applications to the South Carolina Emergency Management Division.

Anti-displacement

The State plans to minimize displacement of persons or entities and assist persons or entities displaced as a result of implementing a project with CDBG-DR funds. This is not intended to limit the ability of the State to conduct buyouts or acquisitions for destroyed and extensively damaged units or units in a floodplain.

The State will ensure that the assistance and protections afforded to persons or entities under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act (URA), and Section 104(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 are available. The URA provides that a displaced person is eligible to receive a rental assistance payment that covers a period of 42 months. The State accepts the HUD waiver of the Section 104(d) requirements which assures uniform and equitable treatment by setting the URA and its implementing regulations as the sole standard for relocation assistance under FR-5938-N-01.

The State will designate a URA specialist to ensure compliance with the Uniform Relocation Act (URA), where applicable.       81 | Page Section 6: Program Administration

Citizen Participation Plan The State values citizen and stakeholder engagement.

South Carolina has developed a Citizen Participation Plan in compliance with § 24 CFR 91.115 and applicable HUD requirements to set forth the policies and procedures applicable to citizen participation. This plan is intended to maximize the opportunity for citizen involvement in the planning and development of the South Carolina CDBG-DR recovery program.

In order to facilitate citizen involvement, South Carolina has laid out target actions to encourage participation and allow equal access to information about the program by all citizens. South Carolina intends to focus outreach efforts to facilitate participation from individuals of low and moderate income, those living in slum and blighted areas, those living in areas identified for recovery through CDBG-DR, non-English speaking persons, and other disadvantaged populations. 

The State will publish its Action Plan in Spanish as well as English.

In addition to citizen involvement, South Carolina encourages the participation of regional and State-wide institutions, especially Volunteer Organizations Active in the Disaster (VOADs).

South Carolina will consider any comments received in writing, via email, or expressed in-person at official public hearing events. Additionally, in an effort to permit public examination and public accountability, South Carolina will make the above information available to citizens, VOADs, public agencies, and other interested parties upon request.

Public Hearings South Carolina will hold 4 public hearings during Action Plan development to collect early input from citizens impacted by Hurricane Matthew. Notice of public hearings will be announced on the South Carolina Disaster Recovery Office (SCDRO) website and published in the local newspaper, as well as on social media. Public hearings will be held at a time and location convenient to potential and actual beneficiaries.

The State will have the capability to take questions and comments in

English and

Spanish at each of the Town Halls. 

South Carolina will consider any comments or views of citizens received in writing or orally at the public hearing. The SCDRO will prepare for each public event by utilizing the public hearing checklist found in the Appendix.

Individuals who require auxiliary aids or special assistance at public hearings should make a request at least forty-eight hours in advance of the event to the SCDRO by contacting (803) 896-4068 or ContactSCDR@scdr.sc.gov. Citizens with hearing impairment may call Relay South Carolina at 7-1-1 for assistance.         82 | Page Public Hearings will be held from April 3, 2017 through April 6, 2017 from 6PM to 7PM at the following locations:

Public Notice and Comment Period Notice of public comment period will be provided by publication on the South Carolina Disaster Recovery Office website.

South Carolina will open the citizen comment period for the following timeframes:

Comment period for the original Action Plan will take place for fourteen (14) days after the publication of the Action Plan to the SCDRO website.

Comment period for Substantial Amendments will take place for fourteen (14) days after the publication of the Substantial Amendment to the SCDRO website.

Comment period for Quarterly Performance Reports will take place for three (3) days after the publication of the Quarterly Performance Report to the SCDRO website.

Action Plan The Action Plan defines how South Carolina will effectively use all available funding to support a data-driven recovery based on the calculation of unmet need across South Carolina. The Action Plan describes the Stateas identifying the beginning and end dates for each disaster recovery activity, and performance and expenditure schedules.

Before South Carolina adopts the disaster recovery Action Plan, the State will seek public input on program design issues including the amount of assistance South Carolina expects to receive, the range of activities that may be undertaken, the estimated amount that will benefit persons of low-to-moderate income, and plans to mitigate displacement.     83 | Page A summary of all comments received will be included in the final Action Plan submitted to HUD for approval. The final Action Plan approved by HUD will be posted to the SCDRO website.

Amendments to the Action Plan South Carolina will engage citizens throughout the program lifecycle to maximize the opportunity for input on proposed program changes that result in a Substantial Amendment. Program changes result in a Substantial Amendment when there is:

An addition or deletion of any allowable activity described in the approved application; An allocation or re-allocation of more than $1 million; or

A change in planned beneficiaries.

Citizens will be provided with no less than fourteen days to review and provide comment on proposed substantial changes. A summary of all comments received will be included in the final Substantial Amendment submitted to HUD for approval. Final Substantial Amendments approved by HUD will be posted to the Disaster Recovery website.

For other non-substantial amendments, the State shall notify HUD, but public comment is not required. 

Every amendment, substantial or not, shall be numbered sequentially and posted on the SCDRO website, not replacing, but in addition to all previous versions of the plan.

Performance Reporting In accordance with HUD requirements, South Carolina will submit a Quarterly Performance Report (QPR) through the HUD Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting (DRGR) system no later than thirty days following the end of each calendar quarter. Three days before submission to HUD, South Carolina will post each QPR for public review and comment on the SC Disaster Recovery Office on a quarterly basis until all funds have been expended and all expenditures have been reported.

Limited English Proficiency South Carolina is committed to providing all citizens with equal access to information about the recovery program, including persons with disabilities and limited English proficiency (LEP). The State follows HUD's

Housing and Urban Developmentall recipients of federal financial assistance from HUD to provide meaningful access to LEP persons.

Persons who do not speak English as their primary language and who have a limited ability to read, write, speak, or understand English may be entitled to language assistance with respect to a particular type of service, benefit, or encounter.

Where a significant number of non-English speaking residents can be reasonably expected to participate in public hearings or open comment periods, materials to be handed out will be translated into the appropriate language, citizen comments in a language other than English will be translated, and translators will be present.

As a result of initial population analysis, the Action Plan, any ensuing amendments, outreach materials and the application and related guidance materials will be published in both English and Spanish. When     84 | Page  needed, the State applicants to point to in request for specialized translation services.

Technical Assistance Upon request, limited technical assistance will be provided by SCDRO program staff. Requests should be made in a timely manner and within the time parameters of the appropriate program design.

The State may contract with a Technical Assistance Provider(s) should sufficient demand for technical assistance warrant.

The State does not anticipate a significant demand for technical assistance because programs will be administered directly by the State, with no subrecipients or sub-grantees.

Citizen Complaint Procedures The State of South Carolina will handle citizen complaints through a Constituent Services Team, which will

State, its CDBG-DR Contractor, and/or other program sources, will be reviewed by the Constituent Services Team for investigation as necessary. 

The Constituent Services Team will ensure complaints are resolved, escalated to appropriate personnel if needed, and any necessary follow-up actions are completed.

The aim of the State will be to always attempt to resolve complaints in a manner that is both sensitive

The goal of the State and its Constituent Services Team is to provide an opportunity to resolve complaints in a timely manner, usually within 15 business days, as expected by HUD, if practicable, and to provide the right to participate in the process and appeal a decision when there is reason for an applicant to believe their application was not handled according to program policies. All applications, guidelines, and websites will include details on the right to file a complaint or appeal, and the process for filing a complaint or beginning an appeal. ns will be made on housing assistance applications and/or housing unit projects to be delivered. These decisions will be made based on applicable statutes, codes of federal regulation, State and local codes and ordinances, and program operational procedures, as each is interpreted by the State of South Carolina. During the course of these activities, it is possible that citizens may decide they have a legitimate reason to appeal a decision. 

Applicants are allowed to appeal program decisions related to one of the following activities: 1.

A program eligibility and/or priority determination; 2.

A program assistance award calculation; and 3.

A program decision concerning housing unit damage and the resulting program outcome.

Citizens may file a written complaint or appeal through the Disaster Recovery email at ContactSCDR@scdr.sc.gov or submit by postal mail to the following address:

Attention: Constituent Services South Carolina Disaster Recovery Office, 632 Rosewood Drive, Columbia, SC 29201      85 | Page South Carolina will make every effort to provide a timely written response within 15 working days of the receipt of complaint, where practicable. If the complainant is not satisfied by the Department of Commerce Ombudsman response, the complainant may file a written appeal by following the instructions issued in the letter of response. If at the conclusion of the appeals process the complainant has not been satisfied with the response, a formal complaint may then be addressed directly to the regional Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) at:

Department of Housing & Urban Development 1835 Assembly Street, 13th Floor, Columbia, SC 29201

State Outreach

During the development of this Action Plan, the State will conduct in-person meetings with key regional stakeholders as well as the general public. The State has conducted meetings with county administrators, key legislators, public representatives and the VOADs throughout the development of the unmet needs assessment, projected budget, recovery activities and program administration as set forth in this Action Plan. In addition, the Stateen heavily informed by the socially vulnerable areas identified in the Unmet Needs Assessment. Outreach activities will be targeted towards this audience in order to ensure the most vulnerable populations receive enhanced focus.

Program Intake An applicant intake center will be established in Marion County within 30 days of the implementation contractor and the State executing a contract for the Hurricane Matthew CDBG-DR program. This intake center will accept applications for program participation for 90 days. Additional outreach and application acceptance will be conducted through mobile intake centers throughout the Hurricane-affected area. 

All intake locations will have the capability to service citizens who have limited English speaking capabilities or require sign language.

Program Income The State does not intend to implement any programs that generate income as described in 24 CFR 570.489. If program income is generated, the State of South Carolina will follow guidance provided in: 17. 

Program income alternative requirement on pages 44  48 of 81 FR 39702 (2016). Per that guidance, income received prior to the grant closeout will be utilized as additional CDBG-DR funds in the same manner as other CDBG-DR funds referenced. Any income received after the grant closeout, will be

Pre-agreement Activities The provisions of 24 CFR 570.489(b) and 570.200 (h) permits a State to reimburse itself for otherwise allowable costs incurred by itself or its recipients sub grantees or sub recipients on or after the incident of the covered disaster.

The provisions at 24 CFR 570.200(h) and 570.489(b) apply to grantees reimbursing costs incurred by itself or its recipients or subrecipients prior to the execution of a grant agreement with HUD. This includes but is not limited to activities supporting program development, action plan development and stakeholder involvement support and other qualifying eligible costs incurred in response to an eligible disaster covered under Public Law 114-254.      86 | Page The South Carolina Department of Commerce incurred pre-award costs and is seeking reimbursement for these costs that are reasonable and allowable under this regulation. The Department of Commerce intends to recover the pre award costs consistent with the authority cited in this section.

These costs include the cost for salary, employer fringe benefits, and direct operating cost for each employee based on their individual percentage of time spent on the planning of the CDBG-DR program.       87 | Page Section 7: Pre-award Implementation Plan The South Carolina Department of Commerce is the administrator and fiscal agent for the CDBG-DR grant. 

The Department manages an annual budget of over $100 million and has prior experience in managing HUD funds through the CDBG allocation for many years. The Department of Commerce through the SCDRO is currently managing a $96.5M grant for the October 2015 Storm.

Through experience with the annual CDBG program and the October 2015 CDBG-DR program, the Department of Commerce has existing systems and procedures, as well as formally established monitoring strategies that meet or exceed regulatory requirements including those related to HUD program rules and regulations, civil rights, environmental, labor standards, fair housing, citizen participation and recordkeeping.

The newly developed CDBG-DR program will leverage these existing resources and adapt them to the requirements of Public Law 114-254 and related guidance.

South Carolina will manage grant funds responsibly, efficiently and transparently. The State has the financial management systems, policies, procedures and practices necessary to uphold fiscal responsibility as detailed in this Implementation Plan.        88 | Page Financial Controls The State of South Carolina certifies proficiency in financial management through the use of established financial systems and internal controls. The sections below provide further description of existing risk management measures.

Additional information can be found in the HUD Financial Management Guide, completed by the State, which answers specific questions about financial standards and which personnel or unit are responsible for each item. The completed guide and accompanying procedures will be submitted to HUD in addition to the Action Plan and Implementation Plan.

Single Audit The State of South Carolina is in full compliance with Single Audit requirements. The Stateexpenditures are consistently reviewed every year by an independent Certified Public Accountant (CPA) to evaluate whether the Statecontracts and grant rules as applicable to each program. The latest Single Audit report for the fiscal year 2015 is attached to this plan. The State maintains reports and working papers for each annual report for a minimum of three years from the date of submission to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.

Under the existing structure for annual

CDBG, South Carolina monitors subrecipients for compliance with financial administration requirements in accordance with Single Audit requirements previously stipulated in OMB Circular A-133, now codified in 2 CFR 200, Subpart F.

The Department requires all program subrecipients who expend more than $750,000 in federal funds during the fiscal year to submit their Single Audit review through the Stateinghouse or directly to the State for review for material weaknesses and findings or concerns. Subrecipient compliance with audit requirements has been and will continue to be maintained through an internal monitoring tracking system updated on a routine basis.

This system was designed as part of a corrective action plan to a Single Audit Finding in the South Carolina Statewide Single Audit for the Year Ended June 30, 2015. The audit identified that one of the program subrecipients failed to provide the State with a copy of their Single Audit by the deadline.

Financial Management Systems South Carolina Department of Commerce maintains multiple accounting and grants management systems to support a multi-functional grants management program. These systems provide accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial status of each CDBG supported activity, according to the terms and conditions of the Grant Award Agreement. These systems are audit-tested and confirmed to meet all Federal and State requirements.

Recipient accounting records are supported by source documentation stored in compliance with record-keeping requirements. South Carolina has financial record-keeping practices to retain source documentation for accounting records that will be applied to the CDBG-DR program to ensure records adequately identify the source and application of CDBG-DR funds provided and maintain source documentation to evidence the costs incurred and dates of expenditure.      89 | Page Internal Controls The Department has existing policies and procedures meeting financial management requirements including: applicable regulations and requirements, financial accountability and records, authorized signatures for payments and checks, requests for payments, bank accounts and checks, escrow accounts, administrative costs, property management, and audit requirements.

The department has cash management procedures in place that minimize the elapsed time between receipt and disbursement of CDBG funds. A copy of the current Community Development Block Grant program manual, which includes these procedures, can be found on the public website at: https://www.cdbgsc.com/sites/default/files/cdbg/Manual/2016%20CDBG%20Manual%20posted%201-2017.pdf

The organizational structure encompasses risk management measures that establish clear lines of authority and approval, segregation of duties, separation of key processes and authorization and secure access to financial resources. The program financial division is overseen by the Chief Financial Officer with sub-divisions for Financial Monitoring &

Compliance, and Financial Management. A full organizational chart can be found in the Capacity and Staffing section of this plan.  -DR funds and support the prevention of fraud, waste and abuse to ensure:

No person involved in the program decision-making obtains financial benefit

Procurement Procurements for CDBG-DR programs are governed by those specific procurement requirements set forth under 24 CFR Part 570, Part 85, 2 CFR 200.318-200.326 and all applicable State laws and regulations. Aligned with the requirements of these federal regulations, when procuring property or services to be paid for in whole or in part with CDBG funds South Carolina will follow its own procurement policies as those procedures are as stringent, or more so, than the federal procurement requirements. Furthermore, the State shall ensure that each procurement occurs with full and open competition.

South Carolina has a two-tiered procurement system for State agencies. Agencies have direct authority to make purchases below a certain dollar threshold. Above that amount (which differs for each agency), procurements are conducted under the authority of a central procurement office that serves all State agencies covered by the South Carolina Consolidated Procurement Code. Known as Procurement Services,     90 | Page  this office involves three subdivisions with purchasing authority: the Office of the State Engineer (OSE), the Information Technology Management Office (ITMO), and the State Procurement Office (SPO).

The policies and procedures shall also include ethical standards of conduct governing employees engaged in the award or administration of contracts. Recipient will maintain a written code of standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts.

Conflict of Interest provisions listed at 24 CFR Part 85.36 (3) and all other applicable federal regulations will be incorporated.

Generally, the governing statutes can be found at Title 11, Chapter 35 of the South Carolina Code of Laws. 

Procurements subject to the South Carolina Procurement Code (S.C. Code Ann. § 11-35-10 et. seq. 1976, as amended) are also governed by procurement regulations promulgated by the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Authority, which are available in Article 19 of the South Carolina Code of Regulations. (The Procurement Regulations begin at Regulation 19-445.2000.) Methods of procurement (e.g., small purchase, sealed bids/formal advertising, competitive proposals, and noncompetitive proposals) and their applicability shall be specified by the State.

As outlined in the table below and in the South Carolina Procurement Code and Regulations, the State uses a variety of competitive source selection processes, including three simplified "small purchase" procedures, five standard competitive procedures (competitive sealed bidding, competitive best value bidding, competitive fixed price bidding, competitive on-line bidding, and competitive sealed proposals), qualification based selection procedures for the acquisition of construction-related professional design services; and, indefinite delivery contracts for construction and related design services. A primary focus for the State is that opportunities be made available for small and minority businesses. Accordingly, the State maintains a robust Small & Minority Business Contracting and Certification Program.

State align with the requirements set forth under 2 CFR 200.318-200.36 ensuring fair and open competition. Further ensuring consistency with federal requirements, South Carolina shall ensure that all purchase orders and contracts include any clauses required by Federal statutes, executive orders and implementing regulations.

Contract Clauses and their Administration     92 | Page Duplication of Benefit In accordance with the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, Public Law 93-288 as amended, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5207, the State will implement policies and procedures to ensure no individual receives duplication of benefit (DOB) for the same purpose and/or effect to recover from the disaster. Federal law prohibits any person, business concern, or other entity from receiving Federal funds for any part of such loss as to which he has received financial assistance under any other program, from private insurance, charitable assistance or any other source. The State has a program policy manual with guidance that funds determined to be a duplication of benefit will be deducted or otherwise offset from the amount of assistance available to the applicant through the CDBG-DR Housing Recovery Program.

To prevent DOB, the State will require that all sources (federal, State, local, private) and amounts of disaster assistance received or reasonably anticipated to be received are documented with submission of an application for CDBG-DR funding. 

The State will procure a qualified vendor to implement DOB procedures in review of each application. The hired vendor will perform a basic calculation known as the recovery need; and then (2) Reducing that remaining recovery need by previously received funding for housing recovery, if any (less amounts expended on Allowable Activities).

This activity will be monitored for accuracy and completeness by the State Monitoring and Compliance division.

The State will consider all amounts received/approved from alternate sources such as FEMA, insurance coverage, SBA and/or philanthropic organizations used to make repairs due to the declared disaster damage. Duplication of benefit for housing assistance will only consider other sources of funding pertaining to structural damage caused by the disaster, assistance for contents and personal items will not be considered duplication. 

The State currently has secured data sharing agreements with FEMA and SBA to ensure the most recent assistance data is used in confirming other Federal assistance.

All applicants will be required to sign a Subrogation agreement upon application to the program. Applicant awardees must subrogate any additional funds received for damage caused by the disaster back to the State. CDBG-DR funding must be funding of last resort and if additional funds are paid to applicant awardees for the same purpose as the housing assistance award they receive through State CDBG-DR funding (i.e., repair or replacement of the damaged structure) after the State has completed repair/rehabilitation project of the housing unit or repair/replacement of the Manufactured Housing Unit (MHU), those funds must be returned to the State of South Carolina.

Timely Expenditure Timeliness of expenditure for the grant funds under Public Law 114-254 is defined as 6 years from the

South Carolina will comply with this timeline by implementing effective budgeting and maintenance of expenditure projections.

Within the 6 year grant timeline, there are also requirements for prompt payment as part of the general financial management process. The State will reconcile these projects with actual transactions as tracked in the general ledger on a regular and frequent basis.      93 | Page The State will track expenditure projections over the life of the award utilizing the HUD-provided Projection of Expenditures and Outcome Template, in conjunction with the Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting (DRGR) system. South Carolina will submit a complete projection of expenditures within 120 days after the initial Action Plan has been submitted through the DRGR system. Revised projections will be sent to HUD when program changes impact projected outcomes, funding levels, and recovery timelines.

The State of South Carolina has adequate databases and procedures in place to monitor program expenditures, track timeliness of expenditures, evaluate grant recipient performance, and monitor overall financial and programmatic compliance status of HUD grant funds. The State has existing, mature systems in place to administer HUD CDBG grants, which have been audit-tested and received no findings from HUD regional or OIG audit teams.

The State will manage financial transactions through the

SCEIS record system, and will use either its existing grants management system or an alternative file or record system operated by the Implementation Contractor who will undertake implementation of the States CDBG-DR grant, provided that the alternative system can provide comparable utility with respect to financial and programmatic grant management. The grants management system contains extensive detail about grant-funded projects and is used to generate award documents, financial reports, voucher summaries, fiscal and program year HUD grant financial status reports.

It is also used to generate payment vouchers when pay requests are received from grant recipients. For HUD CDBG grants, these vouchers are entered into the State With respect to timely expenditures, the State will track expenditure projections based on the date the HUD CDBG-DR grant is signed, award dates for all subrecipients of CDBG-DR funds, payment request dates and amounts, and date funds are received from HUD. Other data elements will be added as necessary to provide information sufficient to monitor timeliness of recipient expenditures, time elapsed since last recipient draw, time elapsed since recipient grant award, percent of recipient grant drawn compared with progress on the funded project, as indicated by recipient status reports, etc.

Grants which appear to be lagging will be evaluated and, consistent with the State-DR Action Plan, either: a) provided technical assistance to remediate their slow progress state, b) terminated if the project appears to be stalled at startup and the Action Plan allows for re-award to other eligible recipients, or c) the project scope will be reduced and the recipient award reduced as necessary and recaptured funds re-obligated identifying fast-moving projects and recipients that have already demonstrated competence in expeditiously moving projects forward, drawing funds and moving projects toward completion.

Consistent with the State-DR Action Plan, the goal will be to obligate funds that will be available for recipients (i.e., excluding funds set-aside for program administration) as soon as possible in order to maximize the amount of time new recipients have to implement projects and expend available funds. 

Recipients will be required, as they are for the State CDBG Program, to identify under-budget contracts, changes in beneficiary eligibility, project scope changes, etc. as soon as possible. This will allow the State to identify funds recipients are not expected to draw, permitting the State to identify recipients with on-    94 | Page  track projects where recaptured funds can be redirected, and reduce funds awarded to non-performing recipients or recipients at risk of non-performing. Where necessary, the State will identify additional eligible recipients and projects (per the State-DR Action Plan) that have existing funded projects and require additional funding for new/expanded project activities, or that have projects that can move forward immediately. This will allow for the State to expeditiously expend funds to accomplish program goals while complying with all applicable requirements.

Management of Funds Monitoring will be conducted by the Department of Commerce and the SCDRO based on a pre-defined risk analysis and will be conducted on a frequency as determined by the analysis which will include frequent desk review and periodic on-site visits. SCDRO will monitor funds using the HUD Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting (DRGR) system and meetings hosted by the Contracts Manager and Statistical and Research Analyst III (DRGR Specialist.) Audit functions will be conducted by the designated Department of Commerce auditors hired to support this program as outlined in the Financial Roles section of this document.

The risk analysis will consider criteria consistent with HUD guidance and individualized risk mitigation strategies will be prepared for each funding recipient. 

The State will follow steps for identifying risks that include the following:

Identify what CDBG-DR projects and performance areas are to be assessed; Insure that risk is identified and analyzed; Assign weight to risk factors; Develop rating criteria and methods to assessing risk; Determine rating by factor; Compile scores and rank organizations; and

Utilize resources for monitoring and risk mitigation.

The State may initiate additional, unscheduled monitoring efforts at any time based on analysis of risk indicators. The State will utilize existing processes for the annual CDBG program for conducting on-site reviews that include written monitoring and technical assistance guidelines, checklists, and policies and procedures.

Project files will be reviewed for compliance with HUD requirements.

In July 2015, the HUD field office reviewed monitoring procedures, execution of those procedures and adherence to guidance and timelines. The final audit report determined the Statemonitoring program to be in compliance with HUD standards. In the most recent HUD On-Site Monitoring Report conducted July 2015,

Statemeets the standards found at 24 CFR 570.492 and the Housing and Community Development Act (HCDA) Section 104(e)(2) to conduct reviews and audits of its recipients to determine compliance with applicable

A copy of the report can be found attached to this plan in appendix format.

SCDRO will continue to use similar procedures and processes to manage and audit funds for this grant.      95 | Page Contractor compliance will be maintained through the review and approval of monthly project performance reports, financial status reports, and documented requests for reimbursement throughout the contract period. The State will utilize the HUD- provided contract reporting template for upload to the DRGR on a quarterly basis: https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3898/public-law-113-2-contract-reporting-template/.

Beginning shortly after commencement of contracted activities, risk-based on-site monitoring will occur as appropriate to contracted activities and award amounts. At least one on-site monitoring visit will occur prior to project completion, to verify funds were expended appropriately.

All program activities will meet HUD requirements for national objectives, which will be supported by documentation in the program file system of record. South Carolina will not undertake activities other than those activities authorized by the CDBG program CFR 570.201-206. Examples of ineligible activities include:

Buildings for the general conduct of government,

General government expenses,

Financing for partisan political activities,

Purchases of equipment,

Purchases of personal property, and

Operating and maintenance expenses for public facilities.

South Carolina is dedicated to prioritizing assistance toward residents that face the most financial barriers to recovery and fully intends to comply with the HUD Low-to-Moderate Income (LMI) national objective requirement of 70% of the total grant. Residents will be required to provide household income information and supporting documentation at the time of application for processing and verification. 

South Carolina will apply a methodical approach to applicant assistance that assigns priority to program applicants based on household income and other social vulnerability factors. Recovery funds will be accounted for in order of ranked priority (utilizing the eligibility prioritization matrix of the Single Family Housing Program) to allow program staff to consistently budget funds toward the most vulnerable beneficiaries, in as fluid a manner as possible.

The State has a Director of Internal Audit on staff. The audit staff overseen by the Director of Audit will perform a full compliance and financial audit review.

The vendor will review files and test for compliance with financial standards and procedures including procurement practices and adherence to cost reasonableness for all operating costs and grant-funded activities.

All program expenditures will be evaluated to ensure they are:

Necessary and reasonable; Allocable according to the CDBG contract; Authorized or not prohibited under State/local laws and regulations; Conform to limitations or exclusions (laws, terms, conditions of award, etc.);     96 | Page Consistent with policies, regulations and procedures; In accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS); Adequately documented; and

Treated consistently (with non-CDBG costs).

The State of South Carolina is dedicated to the prevention of fraud, waste and abuse. All suspected cases of fraud will be taken seriously and reported to the South Carolina Office of the Inspector General for further investigation: http://oig.sc.gov/Pages/default.aspx.

Comprehensive Disaster Recovery Website In accordance with HUD requirements, South Carolina will maintain a public-facing website with program information pertaining to applicants and stakeholders posted on an ongoing basis. The initial website will reside on the South Carolina Disastery Recovery Office website at http://www.scdr.sc.gov during action plan development and program setup. 

The State plans to design, launch and maintain a customized program website shortly after execution of the Grant Agreement and program implementation begins. 

The public website serves as a central source for program information and transparency in the management of federal dollars. It is a powerful tool for public participation and engagement.

The State of South Carolina follows ADA-compliant standards for website accessibility and readability. 

Content and webpage layout is designed with best practices for adaptive aids use in mind. The State also supports accommodation for citizens with limited English proficiency and will publish program documents to the public website in languages other than English based on the need of non-English speaking communities.

The Information Technology division of the Department of Commerce maintains ownership of the Depar involved in publishing all content to the Disaster Recovery page in cooperation with SCDRO staff.

Content for the site will be generated from all aspects of the program and will be drafted by operational staff with purview over the subject matter. All content will undergo draft review before final approval prior to posting.

The following program information that will reside on the website includes but is not limited to:

Announcement of Public Hearings will be posted to the website as well as local newspapers.

Action Plan for Disaster Recovery will be posted to the SCDRO website for no less than 14 calendar days to solicit public comment before being submitted to HUD. The final approved Action Plan will then be posted to a permanent section on the website designated for Action Plans and Amendments.

The DRGR Action Plan will be posted to the program website once established.

Substantial Action Plan Amendments will be posted on the SCDRO website for no less than 14 calendar days to solicit public comment before being submitted to HUD. The final approved Action Plan Amendment will then be posted to a permanent section on the website designated for Action Plans and Amendments.     97 | Page Non-substantial Action Plan Amendments will not be posted for public comment. These Amendments will be posted to a permanent page designated for Action Plans and Amendments.

Each Quarterly Progress Report (QPR) will be posted to the program website for no less than 3 days to solicit public comment before being submitted to HUD. The final QPR will then be posted to a permanent section designated for Reporting.

The Citizen Participation Plan will reside permanently on the program website.

An electronic portal for citizen complaints and concerns will be located on the program website.

Program announcements will be posted to the program website on a rolling basis as approved by the Program Director.

Timely Information on Application Status South Carolina will implement a centralized application management system with real-time access to application status. 

Applicants can obtain timely communication about their application status at any time during operational hours by contacting a case manager via telephone, leaving an after-hours voicemail message to be returned the following business day, or by submitting an email inquiry.

Case managers will be available for face-to-face intake meetings as requested by the applicant. 

Accommodations can be made ahead of time for applicants with physical disabilities and/or a need for translation services.

Proactive communication from the program regarding application status will occur on a frequent basis during initial intake. At which time, program staff will proactively contact applicants to request missing eligibility documentation and verify information entered on the application form. Once all documentation is received, verbal communication may subside until the applicant is contacted through an official letter with information regarding eligibility.

The State will also institute a Constituent Services Team focused on resolving complaints in a timely manner, usually within fifteen (15) business days, as expected by HUD, if practicable. The Constituent  participate in the process and appeal a decision when there is reason for an applicant to believe their application was not handled according to program policies. 

All applications, guidelines, and websites will include details on the right to file a complaint or appeal, and the process for filing a complaint or beginning an appeal.       98 | Page Capacity Assessment & Staffing South Carolina has conducted a thorough capacity assessment and developed the current administrative structure (as shown below) for positions to support critical management, oversight and implementation.
