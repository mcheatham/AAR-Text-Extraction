FEMA-4188-DR-WA !Appendix B: Non-Federal Land BAER Assessment     1 Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) Report Carlton Complex Fire (State and Private Team) September 14, 2014   2 Introduction This report summarizes fire and potential post-fire effects to critical values {e.g. human life and property (roads, buildings, water systems, etc.), and degradation of natural resource (soil productivity and hydrologic function), municipal, domestic, agricultural water supplies, habitat for federally listed species under the Endangered Species Act, and cultural resources}within or in close proximity to burned lands.

This rapid evaluation was conducted to determine if these critical values are at risk due to imminent post-fire threats and recommend emergency stabilization and long-term restoration actions that can be taken to minimize unacceptable impacts resulting from the Carlton Complex fire that burned private property, and lands managed by the Washington Department of Natural Resources, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife,

Confederated Tribes of the Colville Nation, Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Forest Service.

Given the size and severity of the Carlton Complex fire on Washington State and private lands, the Okanogan Conservation District asked Governor Inslee to request for a Multi-jurisdiction Assessment Team for the Washington State and private lands. After President Obama signed the Disaster Declaration on August 11th, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) began coordinating with the Okanogan Conservation District and the Forest Service to staff this team to complete an assessment on Washington State and private lands.

This Multi-jurisdiction Assessment Team has worked in close coordination with Forest Service BAER teams on the Carlton Complex Fire to create a seamless evaluation of all lands burned in the Carlton Complex Fire. 

Burned Area Description The Carlton Complex started on July 14th from four lightning caused fires (Stokes, Gold Hikes, French Creek and Cougar Flat) burning over 250,000 acres, consisting of National Forest System lands on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest,

Bureau of Land Management lands, Washington State and private lands. Hot weather and windy conditions pushed the fire over the ridge tops and into the town of Pateros resulting in a large number of evacuations. The fire made significant runs towards the cities of Brewster and Pateros between July 17th and 18th, consuming approximately 300 homes in its path and destroying critical infrastructure. These fires grew into one larger fire on July 20th. Great Basin Incident Management Team 1 assumed command of the Carlton Complex, along with the Little Bridge Creek Fire and the Upper Falls Fire on August 11th.

L. 

Vegetation Types: Range  shrub steppe composed of blue bunch wheatgrass/antelope bitterbrush on all aspects at lower elevations and on south aspects transitioning to forest communities. Forested areas are composed of Ponderosa Pine and grass/shrub understory and mixed conifer types of Ponderosa Pine and

Douglas fir with an understory of grass, forbs and shrubs. 

M. 

Dominant Soils: Dominant soils within the burn area are well drained and have a xeric (dry) soil moisture regime and mesic (warm) and frigid soil temperature regimes. Mesic soils are present at lower elevations, and support shrub/steppe plant communities; where forested they occupy south and some west aspects and support

Ponderosa pine/grass and shrub vegetation. Frigid, forested soils are on north and east aspects and support mixed conifer (Douglas fir and Ponderosa pine) and forb/shrub understory vegetation.

Soils on the terraces, ground moraines, foothills and mountains consist of medium to very coarse textures of granitic colluvium and residuum and outwash and till derived from mixed sources; but dominantly granitic in origin. Thick deposits of till and outwash overlie bedrock composed of granite, schist and metasedimentary rock.  In areas where the till mantle has thinned; soils have developed in residuum and colluvium derived mainly from igneous (intrusive), metamorphic and some metasedimentary rock. The surface of the soils are influenced and mantled with volcanic ash from air fall events from various sources (dominantly from Mt. 

Mazama). Generally, the surface textures are medium and coarse and have moderate and high infiltration. 

Subsoil textures range from medium to very coarse and have moderate to very rapid permeability. In subsoils in which a dense layer is present, permeability is restricted. Surface and subsurface rock fragment content ranges from 0 to over 65 percent and range in size of gravel, cobbles and stones. Many areas within the burn area have rock outcrop, cobbles, stones and boulders on the soil surface.

Soil depth ranges from less than 20 inches to greater than 60 inches to restrictive layers. Dominant restrictive layers are unweathered (hard) and weathered (soft) bedrock generally granitic in origin and dense (compacted), non-cemented subsoil layers formed in till parent materials. Dominant soils are Haploxerolls, Inceptisols and Andisols and are represented by the Conconully, Kartar and Parmenter soil series respectively.  4 The erosion hazard within the fire perimeter varies by soil type. Their texture, structure, rock content, permeability, and slope are principle factors in their susceptibility to surface erosion. The following table displays the proportion of relative erosion hazard on the non-federal lands within the fire USDA 2008, USDA 2010).  N.  Geologic Types: The burned area lies in the Columbia Intermontane Province within the Columbia plateau and on the eastern slope of the Cascade Mountains. The Cascade Mountains, Eastern Slope, is a transitional area between the Cascade Mountains to the west and the lower lying Columbia Basalt Plateau to the south and east. 

It has some of the landforms typical of both the mountains and plateau. The mountainous areas consist mainly of Pre-Cretaceous metamorphic rocks cut by younger igneous intrusives mantled with thick surficial deposits of Pleistocene aged drift and till deposits from the Okanogan Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet (USDA 2006, USDA 2008). Major landforms include terraces, moraines, foothills and mountains. Valley bottoms and riverine systems with their associated floodplains are dominated by quaternary alluvium.

Highways currently have undersized culverts, inadequate ditchline relief culverts, and/or are located within portions of the floodplain. 

These events can top and plug culverts causing loss of road fill, surfacing, and ditchline scour blocking access for days or weeks on critical highways to local communities. Very High Human Life & Safety Property Motorized Access Along Roads Benson, Finley, Canyon, Cow, Texas, Leecher, Whitestone, Chiliwist, French, Frazer, Beaver, Squaw, Gold, McFarland, Black Canyon Threats from flooding, debris flows, breeching of ponds (select drainages) from runoff and sediment in drainages with extensive moderate-high burn severity, and hazard trees, and rockfall. Many roads within the fire perimeter are heavily used by the public. Steep confined channels have already deposited debris and sediment from several intense rain events onto many of these roads.  Very High to High Human Life & Safety Property Homes, outbuildings Benson, Finley, Canyon, Cow, Texas, Davis Canyon, French, Frazer, Beaver, Squaw, Gold, McFarland, Black Canyon Threats from flooding, debris flows, breeching of ponds (select drainages) from runoff and sediment in drainages with extensive moderate-high burn severity; rerouting of runoff and sediment from roads that could redirect it into homes, outbuildings, etc. 

Some valley bottoms and stream channels have aggraded changing the stream courses redirect flows into buildings. 

The Natural Resource Conservation Service Emergency Watershed Protection Program identified 39 structures (homes, outbuildings, etc.) that were at high risk based on the two flood events that occurred August 12-13 and 21. Some additional structures have been identified through this assessment. 

Very High to High Human Life & Safety Property Water Systems Dams/Ponds Finley Canyon (Wenner Lakes), Leecher, Frazer Threats from flooding/debris flows from slopes with extensive moderate-high burn severity that may fill ponds with sediment and runoff breeching dams deliverying stored water and sediment to homes and infrastructure downslope. Very High  7 Property Domestic Water Sources Benson, Canyon, Texas, Davis Canyon, Frazer Threats from flooding, debris flows, breeching of ponds (select drainages) from runoff and sediment in drainages with extensive moderate-high burn severity; rerouting of runoff and sediment from roads that could redirect it into wells. Some valley bottoms and stream channels have aggraded changing the stream courses redirecting flow/sediment into wells. 

Well heads have filled up with sediment in drainage affected by debris flows and may be impacted in other drainages. Very High to High Property Water diversions/!Irrigation systems Benson, Canyon, Frazer, Beaver, McFarland Threats from flooding, debris flows, breeching of ponds (select drainages) from runoff and sediment in drainages with extensive moderate-high burn severity; rerouting of runoff and sediment from roads that could redirect it into wells. Some valley bottoms and stream channels have aggraded changing the stream courses redirecting flow/sediment into wells. 

Well heads have filled up with sediment in drainage affected by debris flows and may be impacted in other drainages. Very High to High Property Utility lines (Above and Underground) Frazer Some above and underground lines are in debris flow paths or along roads that may be scoured by debris flows and runoff.  These events could unbury and damage underground lines or knock down above ground poles in specific locations. Very High Human Life & Safety Property Railroad Watson Draw Wood trestle was recently replaced with several culverts. Crossing could be at risk if headwater ponds breeched. However, overall burn severity in area is low and vegetative recovery should occur within a few years. 

Intermediate Human Life & Safety Property Campgrounds Alta Coulee, Bear State campground at Alta Coulee could be at risk from rolling rocks on adjacent hillslope. However risk existed before fire. 

Debris flows were not a concern at state campground in lower Bear Creek due to a small amount of headwaters burned and low intensity of burn. Low Human Life & Safety Property Rock Quarry Whitestone Small rock quarry occurs immediately below Rat Lake. 

However this area is not at risk due to low intensity burn above quarry and adequate storage above lake if debris flow occurred. Low Natural Resource Steelhead (Critical Habitat) Beaver Creek, Methow River, Gold Creek, Libby Creek, Black Canyon, Loup Loup Creek, and Okanogan River Risk to steelhead and associated designated Critical Habitat due to the threat of post-fire runoff, erosion, ash, and sediment delivery. 

These threats have the potential to negatively affect steelhead populations and lead to the degradation of designated critical habitat, deterring recovery objectives.  There are 45 miles of designated Critical Habitat within the fire perimeter. High  8 Natural Resource Spring Chinook (Critical Habitat) Methow River Risk to spring chinook and associated designated Critical Habitat due to the threat of post-fire runoff, erosion, and sediment delivery. 

These threats have the potential to negatively affect spring chinook populations and lead to the degradation of designated critical habitat, deterring recovery objectives.  There are 25 miles of designated Critical Habitat within the fire. High Natural Resource Bull trout (Critical Habitat) Beaver, Methow River Risk to bull trout and associated designated Critical Habitat due to the threat of post-fire runoff, erosion, and sediment delivery.  These threats have the potential to negatively affect bull trout populations and lead to the degradation of designated critical habitat, deterring recovery objectives. 

There are 37 miles of designated Critical Habitat within the fire perimeter.

High Cultural & Heritage Resource Cultural Sites Chiliwist, Squaw Risk to historic sites (sawmill site, cemetery, roads, ditchlines) from debris flows, wind erosion, and burned vegetation adjacent to site. 

Threats to features and artifact assemblages from erosion or engulfed by debris/mud flows. Very High Natural Resource Native or naturalized communities non-forested All drainages within fire perimeter Field reviews indicate that there is a substantial risk of noxious weed invasion along roads, handlines and dozerlines used during fire suppression activities. This threat is due to the liklihood that some noxious weed seeds were brought into the area by fire equipment that has been used on other wildfires and suppression activity within known noxious weed locations within the burn. 

The slow natural regeneration following moderate to high burn severity also leaves some areas at risk.  Known noxious and invasive weed populations that include Dalmation toadflax, diffused knapweed, and other species are within the fire perimeter, and are expected to aggressively compete with native species for space and nutrients in burned areas. Very High Natural Resource Soil productivity Benson, Canyon, Cow, Whitestone, Chiliwist, French, Frazer,  In high and moderate soil burn severity areas the fire completely consumed the vegetation canopy and the effective ground cover that dissipates rainfall and regulates snowmelt runoff. Even with average precipitation, erosion rates will be accelerated in combination with higher surface runoff efficiencies. A 2- or 5-year rainstorm event occurring during the first two years following the fire will greatly increase the potential for loss of topsoil, including the ash from the burned plant litter and duff that also replenish the soil nutrient pool, and reduce the soil productivity of these sites. The potential soil loss due to snowmelt and thunderstorm runoff jeopardizes the natural vegetation recovery. High Non-Critical Values  9  Range allotments All drainages within fire perimeter Risk to rangeland readiness that supports livestock grazing within burned areas. 

Majority of rangelands burned at lower intensity and should recvoery within 2 years. However, it is important to defer grazing until vegetative recovery meets standards of rangeland health for the area. N/A Farm Fields/Pastures Benson, Leecher, Chiliwist, Frazer, Beaver, McFarland Several fields, ochards, and pastures were impacted by debris flows in August and may be at risk to future flow events N/A Fences All drainages within fire perimeter Many miles of fence was burned or knocked down within the fire. 

Fences will need to be repaired prior to grazing and to protect sensitive areas. N/A Wildlife Habitat All drainages within fire perimeter Mule Deer, Western Grey Squirrel, Sharptailed Grouse, and Rough Grouse habitat was burned. 

N/A * Locations not described for values rated as very high to high were assigned an intermediate or low risk rating 10 Emergency Treatment Objectives:

The goal of the burned area emergency rehabilitation is to:

Reduce threats to personal injury and/or human life to users of Highway 153 by armoring road shoulders and fillslopes at select crossings (Benson, Canyon, Cow, Leecher, and Squaw Creeks) where culverts can plug from future debris flows, wash over the road, and erode the road base. 

Reduce threats to personal injury, human life, and property on county and private roads by adequate draiange (waterbars, culverts, rolling dips, low water crossings, etc.) to handle increased runoff and debris flows. 

Reduce threats to personal injury and/or human life by installing warning signs along roads and select campgrounds. 

Reduce threats to personal injury, human life, and property by maintaining the early warning rain gage network recently installed by Department of Ecology, for 3 to 5 years post-fire. 

Reduce threats to personal injury, human life, and property (approximately 40 homes) as identified by the Natural Rescource Conservation Service (NRCS) through their Emergency Watershed Protection program during the weeks of August 3 and August 10. 

Reduce threats to personal injury and/or human life, property, natural resources in the event of future high runoff events that could breach ponds at inspections, repair and/or controlled breaching. Several ponds have already breached in the Finley Canyon and Leecher drainages causing significant damage.

Limits of excavation required. 

Vegetation to be left undamaged. 

If you are removing a lot of material with numerous trucks, develop a traffic safety plan. Appropriate temporary road closures while equipment is working also may be necessary.  3. Ecology Block/Jersey Barriers Construction of structural barriers can protect infrastructure and reduce or eliminate the risk of damaged caused by debris and flood flows. The location, elevation and placement of structural barriers should be under the direction of the engineer or engineering technician. The extent of the structural barriers should be flagged. Work limits should be marked. If placed barriers are a temporary treatment, a removal plan should also be developed and discussed before construction begins. 4. Rolling Dips Clearly identify the locations of the dips using stakes, GPS coordinates, and maps. 

Consider equipment travel distance between sites and whether the equipment would be transported or walked from each location. Identify logical treatment units that reduce travel time. 

Identify the segment to be treated and determine spacing guidelines. 

Consider intervals suggested in guides based on erosion hazard rating, road grade, and road design speed. 

Ensure that the existing design (spacing) of dips on the road may be sufficient especially when combined with an outslope or inslope to standard specifications. 

Add dips to create a drivable overflow structure. Dip placement in this application is immediately below or downgrade of the culvert. 

Perform any necessary clearing or grubbing to construct the dips as shown on the drawings. 

Excavate and use borrow material during embankment; excavate drainage; shape the roadway (to 4-percent outslope unless otherwise designated in writing) in the drainage dips. The dip invert shall slope 4-percent greater than the road grade. 

Construct dips with a skew angle to the line perpendicular to the centerline of the roadway, as designated in writing. The typical angle is 30 degrees. 

Recommend armoring the surface and lead out.  5. Flood Deflection Dikes Construction of flood deflection dikes can protect infrastructure and reduce or eliminate the risk of damaged caused by debris and flood flows. The location, elevation and placement of structural barriers should be under the direction of the engineer or engineering technician. The extent of the structural barriers should be flagged. Work limits should be marked. 6. Earthfill Super Sacks Construction of flood deflection dikes can protect infrastructure and reduce or eliminate the risk of damaged caused by debris and flood flows. The location, elevation and placement of structural barriers should be under the direction of the engineer or engineering technician. The extent of the structural barriers should be flagged. Work limits should be marked.   7. Road Regrade Design considerations include elevation grades, establish gradient away from home or other infrastructure, and material to be removed at each site.

Surface Impoundment and Dam Stabilization Purpose of Treatment:  1. Protect existing function of dams and impoundments for storing water, providing wildlife habitat, stock watering, or other uses.  13 2. Protect downstream infrastructure, homes and natural resources from risk of damage by flooding associated with overtopping, breaching or other failure of the dam or impoundment. 

The probability of damage or loss to downstream values for these various locations ranges from possible

Potential monetary values of the consequences have not been estimated at this time. 

General Description: The eleven surface impoundments listed in Section B were found to have potential structural and/or operational risks due to erosion and sedimentation associated with increased stream flows. Risks include reduction in storage capacity, potential overtopping or breaching of the impoundment, and resulting damage to downstream resources and infrastructure from release of the impounded water and sediment. 

The following basic treatment practices were identified for reducing structural and operational risks: 1. Inspection of structural integrity of impoundment dams.  Dams that impound 10 acre-feet or greater safety inspection requirements in WAC 173-175-l guidelines. 2. Dredging and removal of excess sediment and debris from the impoundment, outlet(s) and emergency spillway(s). 3. Reconstruction and/or upgrade of damaged or undersized outlets and overflow spillways to meet

WDOE dam safety guidelines. 4. Repair of erosion damage to face of dams using compacted backfill and erosion control planting 5. Abandonment and controlled breaching of dams that are no longer serviceable and stabilization of remaining fill to reduce erosion potential.  Alternatively, the dams may be temporarily breached for a few years to allow for upslope soils to stabilize, and then repaired, including installing outlets and properly-designed emergency spillways. 6. Long term stabilization of impoundment dams, exposed fill and steep slopes upstream of the dam using vegetation cover or rock armoring.

Note that all construction practices will include draining or pumping the impounded water to allow for construction access. Work below the ordinary high water mark of impoundments located on natural streams may require permits from Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as appropriate. 

Property Treatments:

Highway Drainage Improvements Purpose of Treatment: Protect road infrastructure by minimizing erosion of the road surface and side slopes reducing excessive sediment delivery into the watersheds. Protecting the road prism will maintain multiple access paths to the upper Methow population. 

General Description: Drainages listed below have either experienced damage due to storm events that have already occurred or have the potential for significant damage from further precipitation events. !Location (Suitable) Sites: Benson, Canyon, Cow, Leecher, and Squaw. Each site has significant elevation breaks from the road surface to the bottom of the drainages. !Design/Construction Specification(s): Armor road shoulders and slopes at locations of potential overtopping of highway. At locations where drainage facilities may become overwhelmed by flows and erosion of the downstream road prism material may occur, place erosion resistant fabric and rock material. At locations where flow may become routed down the road surface prior to fully crossing the road, material will be placed to channel flow directly across the road.

Purpose of Treatment: The severity of burn in some watersheds, combined with road location, high possibility of flash flooding and debris flow has increased the risk to road and trail infrastructure. The purpose of these treatments is to increase roadway stabilization to pass large water flows and associated bedload and protect road template from increased flows and decrease the chances of washing road fill into adjacent drainage structures and flow channels. Dips and low water crossings will be placed down flow from culverts that will possibly fail. In situations where placement of rolling dips or low water crossing is not feasible the culvert will be replaced. The replaced culverts will be upsized to manage the increased flows. Roadway warning signs and gated closures will be installed to protect forest users where appropriate. 

General Description: Drainages listed below were found to have issues with the road drainage system due to the expected increase in flows. Road damage occurred in varying degrees of severity. Three levels of damage, high, medium, and low, have been determined to use as a generalized descriptors of each watershed. The watersheds will be analyzed based upon a combination of its assigned damage level descriptor and estimated mileage of road at risk. 

Location (Suitable) Sites: County, State, and Private roads within the Benson/Finley, Canyou, Cow, Texas, Leecher, Whitestone, Chiliwist, French, Frazer, Beaver, McFarland, and Squaw-Gold drainages. 

Design/Construction Specifications: 1. Construct Rolling Drain Dip Roadway dips modify the road drainage by altering the template by allowing surface flows to run off the road to prevent any excessive erosion of the surface.  Work includes placing rip-rap armoring required where runoff could possibly cause erosion to the road surface  15 and fill slope. For undersized culverts, rolling dips shall be constructed on each side of the culvert and rock armoring shall be placed on the downstream face of the road slope. 2. Construct Leadoff Ditch Roadway runoff ditches convey stormwater runoff away from the road, helping to reduce excessive erosion of the surface. 3. Construct Roadside Ditch Roadside ditches collect and convey stormwater runoff to a point down-gradient to an existing or newly constructed drain dip or runoff ditch to prevent excessive erosion of the surface. 4. Remove/Replace Culvert Remove existing culvert and replace with new to better convey expected increased flows or remedy deficient culverts that are too damaged to repair.  Work includes placing new surfacing necessary to provide proper cover over the pipe. 5. Recondition Existing Drainage Feature Clean existing drainage dip, runoff ditch, roadside ditch, or channel at culvert inlet/outlet to better convey stormwater runoff off the road or around road to prevent excessive erosion of the surface.  Work includes removing silt and debris that impede the flow or deflect it out of the drainage feature onto the road.  Work also includes armoring of culvert inlet/outlet required where runoff could possibly cause erosion to the road surface and fill slope. 6. Debris Removal from Road Removal of large woody debris and rock from road surfaces. 7. Decommission Road  or WDFW roads where damage that has occurred at a level that has made the road impassable or there is a risk of that level of damage occurring. Gates shall be chained and locked with signs providing information about fire and flood damage risks. 

Point Protections: Utilities, Domestic Wells and Irrigation Systems Purpose of Treatment: Increase protection to threatened infrastructure against damage due to erosion, hydraulic and mechanical forces, and sediment intrusion. 

General Description: The utilities, wells, fish screens and irrigation systems listed in the Enginering Report potential debris flows.  Treatments to provide protection from future damage are similar: temporary or permanent installation of berms.  Where practical, a minimum number of ecology blocks set to enclose the threatened infrastructure is the recommended treatment.  Where ecology blocks cannot be properly seated for stability, a rock berm is recommended.

Natural Resource Treatments:  *Land Treatments:

Seeding Purpose of Treatment: High soil burn severity areas within the Carlton Fire areas are subject to spread of noxious weed communities and invasive species. Many of the noxious weed and invasive species have the potential to out compete native plant communities during post fire recovery. The treatments designed are to protect sensitive native plant communities and supplement remaining native seed banks that promote native plant community recovery and reduce the potential for invasion of noxious weeds into areas disturbed by fire suppression activities and in all burn severity areas. 

Keep out noxious weeds; prevent weed spread, and secondary long term benefit of soil stabilization.

Noxious Weeds EDRR Purpose of Treatment: The purposes of the monitoring are to prevent known noxious weed infestations from spreading and/or increasing in density, to detect and rapidly respond to new infestations associated  17 with fire suppression/fire effects and to prevent potential new infestations resulting from BAER emergency response action. When monitoring actions are initiated personnel will be equipped to immediately treat to eradicate or control infestations of noxious weeds (i.e. hand pulling, herbicide application, biological agent control, seeding of native species).  This allows for the immediate treatment and eradication of infestations as they are discovered. 

General Description: Well-known pathways of weed spread such as roads and drainages occur within the fire area. In addition, the area receives frequent strong winds which are capable of spreading weed seeds, and high levels of use by the public who inadvertently act as vectors for noxious weed spread. 

Because of dozerlines, handlines, roads, and previously infested areas encompass approximately 256,108 acres of state, federal, and private land.  The newly burned soil is vulnerable to rapid establishment of noxious weeds and invasive, non-native plants. Add to this the presence of 152.6 miles of new dozer lines, (areas of soil disturbance), and 26.7 miles of hand lines, and it is clear that without prompt action, the potential for an explosion of invasive weeds on high and moderately burned soils, along with the dozer and hand lines is extremely high. Field reviews by Forest Service BAER team specialists indicate that there is a high risk of noxious weed invasion. This includes Common Mullein,

Dalmatian Toadflax, Yellow Toadflax, Houndstongue, Leafy Spurge, Canadian Thistle, Musk Thistle, Scotch Thistle, and cheatgrass. 

Location (Suitable) Sites:

Across all state managed lands within the fire perimeter. Private, County, and Leased State Lands are responsible for weed treatment on their lands. 

Design/Construction Specifications:  a. Conduct weed detection surveys to identify and remove newly discovered infestations adjacent to existing weed infestations.  b. Conduct weed detection surveys and remove newly discovered infestations along dozer & hand lines, and inside and around noted polygons of high and moderate burn severity areas that are designated for reseeding. c. Treat areas with herbicides, mechanical practices.  d. Seed dozer lines with native seed to discourage repeated ground disturbance and further weed spread from ORV recreation/ activities. 

Monitoring:

Cultural/Heritage Resource Monitoring Purpose of Treatment: Full assessed including updating existing site forms and reevaluating sites for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). 

General Description: Both sites affected by flooding, including one precontact site located on state land and one precontact site located private land, be fully assessed. Date recovery should involve site visitation by a professional archaeologist to update existing documentation and evaluation of the site for

National Register eligibility.  Updated site forms should be submitted to appropriate State and Tribal officials (SHPO/THPO) to seek concurrence and/or comment on NRHP eligibility recommendations. 

Location (Suitable) Sites: Just one of the eight sites identified within moderate burn severity areas located on private lands was relocated during this assessment.  The site consists of the remains of a historic mining town and existing documentation indicates the site had combustible structures/features. 

During the field assessment no standing structures were observed indicating a significant loss of data has occurred.  The site is located within the Squaw Creek drainage and is bisected by the creek.  Moderate intensity burn areas within the site boundary and localized high intensity burn areas on the slopes adjacent to the site suggest the site is vulnerable to debris flows and flooding, which would further impact the site.  One previously undocumented site was identified during the assessment.  The site consists of the remains of a historic logging community with a sawmill, historic road segment, and historic ditch segment.  The site was impacted by a low severity burn and subsequent debris flow/flood event.  During the flood event water was channeled down the historic road segment, flowed downslope into the historic ditch and washed out a segment of the ditch berm.

Chiliwist Creek flows through the  18 site, one flood event has occurred since the fire, and the site remains undocumented and at risk of future flood events. 

Design/Construction Specification(s): None Other: Ground disturbing activity recommended as a result of the BAER assessment, outside the scope -05 in regards to cultural resource compliance.  Projects that have the potential to result in ground disturbing activity need to go through the cultural review process with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation Tribal Historic Preservation Office (THPO).  Activities that have been proposed during team meeting include but are not limited to removal/replacement of culverts, installation of fish screen structures, and construction of point protection structures.

Install relief culverts along ditchlines in Frazer Creek to reduce runoff volumes scouring the roads and spilling onto the highway. Portions of Highway 20 are in the floodplain of Frazer Creek and are now at stream grade due to stream aggradation from debris flows. Some debris fans are also as high or higher than the highway creating a situation where future debris events could more easily wash onto and damage the road. Options to relocate section of

Highway 20 should be investigated. 

Structure relocation or property aquistion should be further evaluated in locations that are indefensible at home site identified by the NRCS that are in areas where deflection berms will not withstand larger strom events and rebuilding homes would place occupants at further risks from flood events. 

Reduce threats to personal injury and/or human life, property, natural resources damage from pond breaching by stabilizing and improving (e.g. inspecting the structural integrity of the dams, removing accumulated sediment, repairing and/or upgrading outlet structures and emergency spillways, etc.) impoundment structures to withstand future fire related runoff and debris flows. Alternatively some ponds may be replaced by installing wells that can irrigate downslope pastures and fields. 

Protect personal property and natural resources (water for domestic uses and agriculture, listed fish habitat, etc.) for wells and water diversions that are -related damage. 

Owners should consider relocating sites outside of the floodplain or to more secure locations that are not prone to additional debris flows, increased runoff and sediment. 

Noxious Weeds EDRR (Second Year of Treatment) Purpose of Treatment: The purposes of the monitoring are to prevent known noxious weed infestations from spreading and/or increasing in density, to detect and rapidly respond to new infestations associated with fire suppression/fire effects and to prevent potential new infestations resulting from BAER emergency response action. When monitoring actions are initiated personnel will be equipped to immediately treat to eradicate or control infestations of noxious weeds (i.e. hand pulling, herbicide application, biological agent control, seeding of native species).  This allows for the immediate treatment and eradication of infestations as they are discovered.

Conduct weed detection surveys and remove newly discovered infestations along dozer & hand lines, and inside and around noted polygons of high and moderate burn severity areas that are designated for reseeding. c.

Cultural/Heritage Resource -The remaining 34 sites that were identified in burned areas appear to be at less risk from post fire events.  With this said, each of these sites are potentially eligible or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places and have likely been adversely effected by direct and indirect effects of the 2014 Carlton Complex fire.  Therefore, a recommendation is being made for updating existing site documentation and evaluation of each site for National Register eligibility.  Following these actions data should be submitted to appropriate officials (SHPO/THPO) for concurrence or comment. 

Fisheries Increase/encourage large wood recruitment and retention to mainstem Methow and fish bearing tributaries. 

Consider brook trout eradication in Frazer creek in 2015.  The recent flood events in Frazer Creek have likely impacted brook trout populations and now may be the ideal time to eliminate this invasive, non-native species from Frazer Creek. 

Limit excessive fine sediment delivery to fish bearing streams but allow for bedload materials to be transported.  Bedload provides gravels for spawning and larger material that provides habitat for fish. 

Riparian replanting and maintenance where weed invasions could limit recovery  this is important to reestablish shade to fish bearing streams. 

Improve irrigation diversion structures to accommodate increased sediment load that is predicted to affect stream conditions for the next 5-7 years.  Additionally, fish screening screens should be updated to improve function. 

Monitoring:

Temperature monitoring in Beaver Creek Sediment monitoring in spawning areas in Beaver Creek and lower Methow Fish population recovery in Beaver Creek: Fish populations in the lower 6 miles of Beaver Creek were likely severely reduced by the recent flooding and mud flows.  Recolonization will likely happen quickly.  A robust fish distribution data set was collected in the years prior to the fire and provides a good opportunity to measure population recovery following a major disturbance. 

Habitat project performance in Beaver Creek: Several major fish habitat projects were completed in 2012 and 2013 and were burned over by the fire.  Comparing the recover y of these treated areas to non-treated area could provide important information that could be used in future project designs.

Rangelands Hundreds of miles of boundary fence and range fences have been lost. An inventory of fences need to be completed to paint an accurate picture of the loss and help prioritize replacement. It is encouraged that boundary fences, fences protecting sensitive areas (wildlife, riparian, etc.), areas needing longer recovery (slope with moderate to high severity burns), and areas being seeded be fenced first. 

Rangeland and grazeable woodlands should be rested for two years (2015-2016) and deferred thru the critical period of the third year (2017) based on field evaluations*using NRCS Range criteria. 

Wildlife Mule Deer  (25% burned at moderate-high severity) restore firelines to prevent the conversion to new motorized roads or trails, and include a variety of palatable shrub species (bitterbrush, choke cherry,  21 service berry, elderberry, mock orange) in rehabilitation plantings to provide for critical long-term winter forage. 

Columbian Sharp-tailed grouse  include water birch in riparian planting/seeding efforts to provide for critical winter forage. 

Western Gray Squirrel avoid additional tree canopy removal in the affected areas and include ponderosa pine in any tree planting efforts.                    2014 CARLTON COMPLEX WILDFIRE BAER CULTURAL RESOURCE REPORT September 12, 2014

Prepared by Kim J. Lancaster Cascadia Conservation District Archaeologist   Introduction The 2014 Carlton Complex Wildfire was started on July 14, 2014 by dry lightening strikes that occurred in four areas within the Methow Valley. 

The lightening storm occurred during a period of prolonged dry, hot weather.  Low relative humidity, high temperatures, and gusty winds fueled the fires, which burned over 250,000 acres.  Lands contained within the fire perimeter include Federal, State, and private lands located primarily within the boundaries of

Okanogan County.  Rain events on August 13, 2014 and August 21, 2014 produced flooding and debris flows within the burn area.

Cultural resources (historic properties) consist of non-renewable resources including archaeological sites, historic structures, and Traditional Cultural Properties (TCPs) such as traditional gathering and ceremonial areas. 

Sites of particular concern include those that possess fire sensitive or combustible materials are highly susceptible to direct effects of fire.  Fire suppression activities including creation of fire breaks, including construction of dozer and hand lines, have the potential to result in direct effects to surface and subsurface cultural features and/or deposits.  Indirect effects that have potential to impact cultural resources include sheet wash erosion, flooding and debris flows, increased site visibility resulting from consumption of vegetation, and threats to cultural structures and/or features associated with hazard trees.

Objectives Identify previously documented cultural resources located on State and private lands within the 2014 Carlton Complex wildfire areas of potential effect (APE).

Analyze direct and indirect effects and potential future effects of the fires to cultural resources.

Propose specific BAER treatments to prohibit future damage to cultural resources determined ﬁeligibleﬂ for listing on the National register of Historic Places (NRHP), per criteria in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 60.4.

Areas of Potential Effect The APE for the 2014 Carlton Complex wildfire is identified as;  all areas within the perimeter of the burned areas located on State and private lands;    all areas of ground disturbance created by fire suppression;     all areas that experienced flooding and debris flows following the fire;  areas with potential for fire-related soil erosion, flooding, debris flows, hazard trees, etc;    locations where looting and vandalism will be increased due to increased visibility of sites because of the fire;   locations of proposed ground-disturbing watershed rehabilitation-related treatments (e.g. culvert pulling, construction of dikes associated with point protection). 

Potential Values at Risk and Methodology Process To ascertain potential values at risk located within the fire perimeter a review of previously documented cultural resources was conducted through the

Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (DAHP) on-line Washington Information System for Architectural and Archaeology Records Data (WISAARD) database. 

Previously documented cultural resources that had been determined ﬁeligibleﬂ for listing to the National Register and those listed as unevaluated were identified as ﬁpotential values at riskﬂ (Table 1). 

Table 1:  Previously documented archaeological sites located within State and Private Lands within the 2014 Carlton Complex fire perimeter. Land Ownership Site Totals NRHP DETERMINATION Eligible

Unevaluated Not Eligible Potential Values at Risk State 44 12 30 2 42 Private 33 3 28 2 31 Totals 77 15 58 4 73  This initial review resulted in the identification of 77 cultural resources located within the Carlton Complex fire perimeter. 

Four (4) sites, previously determined ﬁnot eligibleﬂ for listing to the National Register, were eliminated from the list, as well as eight (8) sites that were listed as ﬁinundatedﬂ. 

The remaining 65 sites were overlaid with a burned area reflectance classification (BARC) layer.

The BARC layer displays burned soil severity, an attribute that indicates which areas sustained high, moderate, and low impacts from the fire. All identified resources were assessed for their potential historic and research value and if that value would be at risk from post-fire processes.  Sites that fell within high and moderate severity and/or sites deemed highly susceptible to fire effects were prioritized for assessment.

Field inspections and application of the BARC map further reduced the number of sites impacted by direct and indirect effects to a total of 39 sites.  Field visits were conducted between September 6-8, 2014 by Cascadia Conservation District archaeologists and BAER team members, Kim J. Lancaster and Mark Amara. 

For each site located post fire assessment notes were completed.  Field notes focused on visual evidence of burn severity including soil color; presence/absence and burn severity of duff, ground cover, shrubs, and trees; presence/absence of erosion (i.e., sheet wash, Aeolian, riling, gulling, flooding and/or debris flow); presence/absence of hazard trees; evidence of visitation/vandalism.  Site locations were updated using a hand held Garmin GPS 62nd and photographs of the site were taken.

Assumptions An effort was made to inspect all sites identified within areas that experienced low, moderate, and high severity burn and sites located within post fire debris flow/flood events.  The limited time allowed for analysis, total area in which sites were located and problematic documentation on a percentage of the site forms led to a need to apply some generalized assumptions to the assessment of cultural resources identified within the 2014 Carlton Complex fire. 

Sites lacking combustible materials located within areas identified as low burn severity were assumed to have little risk from post fire effects, while sites with combustible materials located within the burn area were assumed to have been adversely affected by fire, which likely compromised elements that contributed to the

National Register eligibility of said sites. Assumptions incorporated into the assessment were based on previous BAER assessments carried out on the

Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest (Smith 2012).

Resource Conditions Prior to the 2014 Carlton Complex Fire Prior to the 2014 Carlton Complex fire, cultural resources located on State and private lands were in a relatively static condition.  Natural processes including structural decay and exposure to the elements slowly diminish archaeological site integrity over time, although surface and subsurface cultural features and deposits can retain integrity for long periods of time.  The majority of prehistoric archaeological sites have been subjected to previous burn events; although fire suppression activity employed over the past century in forested areas on State and private lands may well have resulted in higher accumulations of fuel than what would have occurred historically.  Historic sites have been impacted by varying degrees of structural decay based on length of time since abandonment, impacts from grazing and exposure, and in part location. 

Resource Condition following the 2014 Carlton Complex Fire A total of thirty-seven archaeological sites were identified within burned areas on State and private lands. 

Sixteen (16) sites were identified on State land and twenty-one (21) sites were identified on private lands.  Two (2) sites were located within areas impacted by post fire flooding and/or debris flows. 

Eight (8) sites located on private lands identified in areas with moderate to high severity burn an additional site was located in an area impacted by post fire flooding and/or debris flows.

Date recovery should involve site visitation by a professional archaeologist to update existing documentation and evaluation of the site for National Register eligibility.  Updated site forms should be submitted to appropriate State and Tribal officials (SHPO/THPO) to seek concurrence and/or comment on NRHP eligibility recommendations.

The site consists of the remains of a historic mining town and existing documentation indicates the site had combustible structures/features.  During the field assessment no standing structures were observed indicating a significant loss of data has occurred.  The site is located within the Squaw Creek drainage and is bisected by the creek.  Moderate intensity burn areas within the site boundary and localized high intensity burn areas on the slopes adjacent to the site suggest the site is vulnerable to debris flows and flooding, which would further impact the site. 

One previously undocumented site was identified during the assessment.  The site consists of the remains of a historic logging community with a sawmill, historic road segment, and historic ditch segment.  The site was impacted by a low severity burn and subsequent debris flow/flood event.  During the flood event water was channeled down the historic road segment, flowed downslope into the historic ditch and washed out a segment of the ditch berm.

Chiliwist creek flows through the site, one flood event has occurred since the fire, and the site remains undocumented and at risk of future flood events.

Additionally, ground disturbing activity recommended as a result of the BAER assessment, outside the scope of the cultural resources assessment, need to take into account the Governor™s Executive Order 05-05 in regards to cultural resource compliance.  Projects that have the potential to result in ground disturbing activity need to go through the cultural review process with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation Tribal Historic Preservation Office (THPO). 

Activities that have been proposed during team meeting include but are not limited to removal/replacement of culverts, installation of fish screen structures, and construction of point protection structures. 

Recommended Long-Term Treatments and Monitoring The remaining 34 sites that were identified in burned areas appear to be at less risk from post fire events.  With this said, each of these sites are potentially eligible or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places and have likely been adversely effected by direct and indirect effects of the 2014 Carlton Complex fire.  Therefore, a recommendation is being made for updating existing site documentation and evaluation of each site for National Register eligibility. 

Following these actions data should be submitted to appropriate officials (SHPO/THPO) for concurrence or comment.

Office, Wenatchee, Washington.   PRIVATE LAND OKANOGAN COUNTY BURNED AREA EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN CARLTON COMPLEX FIRE ENGINEERING RESOURCE ASSESSMENT I. OBJECTIVES On September 5-8, 2014, a field investigation and assessment were completed for watersheds affected by the Carlton Complex fire. The assessment identified critical values within the watersheds and developed potential treatments to reduce the risk of flood damage caused by the fires. The critical values included: private, county, and state-owned roads and highways, existing structures and homes, wells, dams and surface water impoundments, utilities, irrigation diversions and on-farm systems, trails, mines, and campgrounds.

The investigation is based on a rapid assessment, which may not comprehensively identify the full range of values at risk from further effects of the recent wildfires, but which is believed to represent the typical conditions found in the affected watersheds.  This report provides a general summary of the issues, observations and recommendations identified during this field investigation.

II. ISSUES The watersheds burned in the Carlton Complex fire are predicted to exhibit varying degrees of response through increased runoff and erosion rates, and increased sediment and debris transport. 

This creates a future concern for roads, culverts, bridges, and channels along the drainage paths of the watersheds. 

Road infrastructure may become plugged, overtopped or washed away more frequently than experienced during the pre-fire condition. In addition, homes and associated infrastructure (water supply, wells, utilities, and septic) are also susceptible to damage as well as agriculture fields, dams and irrigation systems.

The report identifies infrastructure at risk within these watersheds, assesses current conditions, and where necessary, recommends treatments to minimize damage from increased runoff.

III. OBSERVATIONS A. Background The Carlton Complex was separated for evaluation into watersheds located in the Methow and Okanogan River Basins. Each watershed was investigated by an engineering team. These watersheds area listed as follows:

Bear, Benson, Beaver Creek, Black Canyon, Canyon Creek, Chiliwist, Cow Creek, Davis Canyon, Frazer, French Creek, Gold Creek, Indian Dan, Leecher, Loup Loup, McFarland, Squaw, Starzman, Texas Creek, Watson Draw and Whitestone.

Figure 1 on the following page shows the spatial location of each of these watersheds.   Figure 1: Watersheds affected by fires

The watersheds were initially evaluated based upon the field assessments of risk to existing infrastructure and the potential for reducing these risks.  Critical values defined as high or very high, using the US Forest Service™s (USFS) Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) assessment protocols, were identified for treatments. Table 1 shows the critical values for each watershed.

Table 1: Critical Values for each Watershed Due to the extent of the burned area and affected infrastructure, it was not feasible to comprehensively identify every individual treatment needed to reduce imminent risks. 

In some cases, the nature of the threat to infrastructure required individual assessment of treatments and costs. However, most of the estimated costs were developed using typical costs per unit of the treated infrastructure, modified by the intensiveness or difficulty of implementing the needed treatment. 

These were derived based on the following:

Roads: Cost per mile

Dams: Cost per typical treatment actions, applied to each individual dam

Homes: average cost per protection structure based on USDA NRCS Emergency Watershed Program (EWP) assessment

Underground Utilities: Assumed protected by road treatments

Point protection of wells, irrigation systems (pivots), fish screens and utility poles: average cost per each

The approach to estimating road treatments and associated costs was based upon categorizing each watershed into either a high, medium or low category for relative damage that had either already occurred due to past precipitation events or the potential for damage from future events. 

Each category has an associated cost per mile for treatment and each watershed has an estimated mileage of road proposed for treatment. By multiplying the mileage of road proposed for treatment by the associated cost per mile for the watershed category of high, medium or low, an estimated cost per watershed for road treatment was reached. 

The costs associated with the high, medium and low categorizations are based upon cost estimates for a combination of the treatments proposed. Table 2 shows the cost per treatment and Table 3 shows the associated cost per mile for the high, medium and low categorizations.

B. Reconnaissance Methodology and Results After completing the field investigations, further reconnaissance was done by reviewing post-fire burn intensity and severity maps, hydrologic flow modeling at specific point of interest, and using GIS to obtain rough estimates of slope percentage for some of the roads. 

The purpose of the reconnaissance was to determine and assess potential negative impacts on the transportation system and other infrastructure attributable to the wildfire. 

C. Findings The reconnaissance of the roads and other infrastructure during the field investigations found several issues pertaining to emergency stabilization. The issues associated with the findings requiring emergency stabilization included plugged or crushed culverts, filled-in ditches and drain dips, undersized culverts, damaged homes and domestic water supply systems, and damaged surface water impoundment dams. 

These issues are further discussed as follows.  IV. RECOMMENDATIONS A. Emergency Stabilization: Emergency stabilization treatments should be implemented as quickly as possible to protect public safety and minimize further damage to roads and infrastructure identified as critical values at risk of damage from debris flows and flooding.  1. Road and Highway Stabilization SR20 Œ Fraser Creek Chiliwist Road Culvert Situation: Recommended treatments are intended to modify roads and drainage structures to accommodate expected runoff flows. Historically roads with burned areas have been impacted by debris flow and flash floods causing culverts to become clogged with sediment and debris. This has caused roads to become damage and delivered sediment into adjacent streams, degrading aquatic habitat values, and sometimes redirecting flood flows and sediment to areas otherwise not at risk.

The majority of the watersheds within the Carlton Complex Fire are expected to see an increase in flow over the next few years, potentially damaging many miles of roads. Many existing culverts and drainage structure on these roads are undersized and/or are insufficient for the expect increase in flows. It is nearly certain that damage will occur if measures aren™t taken to stabilize the roads and drainage structures. Due to relatively higher costs, difficult terrain, and the delays inherent in planning and implementation, the assessment concluded that upsizing culverts to pass predicted storm flow and unpredictable sediment loads is not generally cost-effective.  Instead, simpler and less expensive treatment recommendations were selected.

Recommendations: Treatment to provide drainage of the road and associated ditches in the event of the failure of existing drainage structures is the primary recommendation for emergency action for road protection.  An associated treatment is protection of the road fill where water and debris are anticipated to cross the road surface.  Generally, these treatments involve constructing rolling dips, water bars, and low water crossings across the road surfaces and placing rock armoring on the associated down-slope road fill.

Install waterbars, rolling dips and low water crossings where they will be most efficient and necessary. Rolling dips should be installed on the down slope side of culverts and in locations where culvert failure is possible or likely. These rolling dips will assist to remove water from the roadbed that has become trapped on the road surface causing erosion and travel hazards. Low water crossings can be used when existing culverts need to be removed because of damage or being undersized. Low water crossings can also be used when large drainages cross the road and no engineering control is in place

Other recommended treatments include maintenance of existing drainage structures and removal of individual culverts that were blocked or destroyed in the August 2014 flooding. 

Roads should be inspected following storm events, and culverts, ditches, and catchment basins should be cleared of sediment and debris.  Blocked or destroyed culverts that currently back up large quantities of debris and sediment should be removed to reduce the potential for future catastrophic washouts and resulting downstream debris flows. 

Stream crossings at risk from increased flow, sediment and debris should be protected in the event of overtopping by armored dips designed to convey excess flows across the road surface.  The associated fill material should also be armored. 

Although road decommissioning was recommended in only one location (i.e., along North Fork Texas Creek, where excessive sediment delivery will threaten Texas Creek Road), it could also be considered for low-use roads in other areas where high fire intensities are expected to cause high levels of watershed response.

Decommissioning will involve removing culverts from side drainages, constructing water bars and blocking the entrance to the road.

Variable message signs (VMS) are proposed for several locations that access the Methow Valley and side drainages that show potential for increased flood risk. Portable VMS shall be placed at the intersection of SR 153 and US-97, intersection of SR 153 and SR 20, and on the summit of Loup Loup pass on SR 20. The signs shall be used to warn of potential weather events based upon the early warning weather stations located throughout the burned area.

County roads that provide access to burned watersheds are proposed to have signs located near the mouth of each canyon warning of flood risks during significant precipitation events. 

The signs are proposed for a minimum of three years and shall be displayed prior to the typical spring runoff timeframe and removed once summer thunderstorm threats have passed.  2. Homes and Other Infrastructure

Leecher Creek @ SR 153 Œ BEFORE––––––––––.. –.AFTER Situation: Approximately 40 homes were identified as at risk of flood due to the fire by an NRCS field visit. The field visits were conducted during the weeks of August 3 and August 10. Through the efforts of the Multi-jurisdiction Assessment team additional structures were identified. These structures were identified during field visits, using the burn intensity BARC map, and modeling efforts conducted by Forest Service, National Weather Service, and U.S. Geological Survey personnel. A list of the identified structures was provided to NRCS who will evaluate Emergency Watershed Program (EWP) eligibility and administer protection treatments as needed.

Recommendations: Provide at risk areas and identified structures to NRCS for emergency protection efforts.                3. Dams and Ponds

Watson Draw Pond Leecher Creek Pond Situation: Eleven surface water impoundments were identified as having either ﬁintermediate,ﬂ highﬂ or ﬁvery highﬂ risk of causing significant damage to downstream property, natural resources, and/or public safety in the event of future high runoff events.  In general, the August 2014 flooding events either filled the impoundments and damaged or in some cases breached the associated earth dams.  Four of the impoundments have a design storage capacity of at least 10 acre-feet and, consequently, are regulated by the Washington Department of Ecology™s (WDOE) dam safety rules (WAC 173-175-510).  As of September 5, 2014, WDOE has notified the owners of these impoundments with specific instructions for emergency actions to reduce risk to downstream values in the event of future high runoff events. The seven other impoundments that were identified in the BAER study are smaller ponds that are not regulated by WDOE™s program.

Recommendations: Based on our review of WDOE™s correction notifications and our experience with post-fire outcomes of other earth dam/surface impoundments in similar settings as the Carlton Complex Fire, the engineering team recommends that two of the large, regulated impoundments in Benson Creek watershed (Wenner Lakes No. 4 and No. 2) be inspected by a qualified engineer as soon as possible and specific correction actions be completed.  These actions, which are described in detail in the Specification Sheet, generally consist of rebuilding and upgrading the emergency/overflow spillways repairing access roads and spot repairs to erosion in the dam face. 

For the other three regulated dams in Benson Creek (Wenner Lakes No. 3, 5 and 1) and the two smaller, unregulated impoundments in the Leecher and Fraser watersheds, we believe the most cost-effective treatment is to abandon the ponds, at least temporarily, breach those dams that have not already been breached, and stabilize the soils at the breach site with vegetation.1

After a few years, when soils in the upstream catchment areas have stabilized, it would be appropriate to reconstruct the breached dams and install properly designed outlet structures and emergency spillways, if consistent with the landowners™ land management objectives.   1 Abandoning and breaching the two regulated dams is consistent with WDOE™s correction notification.  Bear Creek flooding through WDFW owned campground. The four unregulated impoundments in Watson Draw represent only an ﬁintermediateﬂ risk to downstream property and natural resources.  The engineering team recommends that each of the dams be inspected by a qualified engineer and properly functioning outlet structures and emergency spillways be constructed at each. Costs for the recommended treatments at each of the impoundments are presented in the Specification Sheet.   4. Above Ground Utilities, Water Diversions, Irrigation Systems and Wells Irrigation Well - Whitestone Irrigation/Fish Screening Facility Œ Beaver Creek Situation: Infrastructure requiring point protection from flood damage was identified during the engineering assessment.  These include utility poles, fish screens, irrigation pivots and wells.  Forty-seven locations were identified where point protection was considered feasible; however, this probably underestimates the actual number.  In particular, wells in proximity to stream channels can be difficult to locate.

Recommendation: Protective berms created from concrete blocks (ﬁecology blocksﬂ) are recommended for emergency protection of threatened infrastructure.  Where blocks cannot be properly bedded for stability, rock berms may be used.  These berms will provide varying level of risk reduction from the hydraulic and mechanical forces accruing from flooding and debris, based on the intensity of the event and the position of the infrastructure in the flood-prone zone.  5. Campgrounds Situation: State-owned (WDFW) campgrounds are located in the floodplains of Bear Creek and

Beaver Creek.  Increased storm flows or mass wasting in the contributing watershed could increase risks to campground users.

Recommendation:

Install signs at campground entrances warning of potential hazards from flash flooding and debris flows.  WDFW should consult with USFS to identify the magnitude of the risk of upstream infrastructure failing and creating additional risks to campground users.

Rehabilitation:

Further watershed and stream channel instability are anticipated in the aftermath of the fires.  To minimize risks to life, property and infrastructure, a general approach of leaving room throughout stream corridors for increased flow, sediment and debris is recommended.  Modeling of hydrologic change and risk of mass wasting (landslides) are being undertaken by the USFS and the USGS, respectively. 

The modeling results should be used to evaluate the severity of risks throughout the burned area.  Rehabilitation actions described below should be prioritized based on the risk to critical values.

Long-term Recommendations:

Relocate infrastructure out of high hazard locations and discourage future development

Reconnect floodplain areas to provide safe zones for sediment deposition

Following watershed stabilization, replace undersized stream crossings

The following treatments should be considered for reducing risk to property and natural resources in the long term.  1. Road and Highway Stabilization Erosion and resulting sediment transport are natural processes that will continue to occur after burned slopes have stabilized with vegetation.  Constriction of stream channels by undersized culverts, and constriction of floodplains by driveways, roads and highways, will continue to exacerbate erosion and sedimentation problems by reducing channel flow capacity during peak runoff events. While wholesale correction of the impacts to natural stream channels by culverts and road infrastructure is impracticable, it is reasonable to take a step-by-step approach by correcting individual problems during the course of future new development and capital improvement projects.

Existing, undersized culverts should be replaced either with bridges that do not constrict the floodplain or culverts that meet WDFW™s ﬁStream Simulationﬂ design guidance and other requirements of the Washington Hydraulic Code.  The design for repairs and upgrades to existing driveways, roads and highways should weigh the present cost of re-routing road fill out of creek floodplains against the long term costs of continually repairing damage after each flood event.  The value of weighing short term versus long term cost for managing transportation facilities is particularly acute in steep canyon areas of Chilliwist Creek, Davis Creek Canyon, and Fraser Creek.

Portions of Highway 20 are in the floodplain of Frazer Creek and are now at stream grade due to stream aggradation from debris flows. Some debris fans are also as high or higher than the highway creating a situation where future debris events could more easily wash onto and damage the road. Options to relocate section of Highway 20 should be investigated.  2. Homes and Other Infrastructure High hazard areas, such as debris fans, alluvial fans, and confined stream corridors, should be identified.  The risks to life, property and infrastructure should be clearly communicated to owners, occupants and users of property and infrastructure within high hazard zones. 

Infrastructure should be relocated from these areas to the greatest degree feasible Œ with indefensible infrastructure being prioritized - and further development discouraged.  Where infrastructure remains within these zones, proposed actions to defend the infrastructure, such as deflection berms, should be carefully analyzed to ensure that no other properties would inadvertently be subject to increased risks as a result of implementation.   3. Dams and Ponds While the recommended near-term treatment for most of the dams and ponds located in high and very high risk areas is to abandon the pond, fully or partially breach the dam, and stabilize the exposed fill soils, it is recognized that the ponds are important assets for many of the affected landowners.  Attachment A of the Surface Impoundment and Dam Stabilization specification contains engineering cost estimates for implementing alternative treatments for stabilizing these ponds and dams, rather than abandoning them.  These treatments include inspecting the structural integrity of the dams, removing accumulated sediment, repairing and/or upgrading outlet structures and emergency spillways, and stabilizing steep slopes in the catchment areas of the ponds with vegetation.  While these treatments will not reduce the risk of dam failure as effectively as abandoning and breaching the ponds, they will provide a degree of improvement, compared to the current situation.

No long term rehabilitation measures are proposed for the ﬁintermediateﬂ risk ponds in Watson Draw.  4. Water Diversions and Irrigation Systems The reconnaissance teams identified several small, privately-owned surface water diversions on creeks throughout the burned areas that were either damaged or destroyed by the August flooding. Several of these have been or are in the process of being rebuilt. Reconstruction of the intakes and pipelines in their original locations puts them in harm™s way for future flood-related damage.  It is recommended that the owners consider abandoning these diversions and replacing them with pumped well systems located in more stable areas located outside of flood-prone creek canyons.  The decision to abandon and relocate would depend on evaluating the immediate cost of installing new well systems against the long term future costs of continually reconstructing the piped surface water diversions after each future flood event.  5. Domestic Wells Domestic wells within floodplains will continue to be at risk of damage and contamination. 

Wherever feasible, new wells should be installed on upland locations and old wells in floodplains should be decommissioned.

These fires grew into one larger fire later in July. Hot weather, windy conditions, and dry fuel moistures coupled with mountainous terrain combined to create high intensity fire behavior. Several towns were threatened and approximately 300 homes were consumed and critical infrastructure destroyed.  This report summarizes fire and potential post-fire effects to soil resources, and includes concerns relative to invasive plants and range lands. It focuses on non-federal burned over lands which comprise about 167,344 acres. The assessment of fire effects to soil, vegetation, and rangeland resources was conducted by a multi-jurisdiction team of soil and range resource specialists. The objectives of this report are to: 1. Evaluate the effects of the fire on soil resources 2. Identify critical soil resource values at high risk of irreversible damage 3. Identify both emergency and long-term treatments that could rehabilitate or protect soil resources from irreversible damage Resource Assessment Soil related resources assessed here and select ancillary issues include a characterization of their inherent properties and a general description of how they were affected by the fire.

Geology and Soils The burned area lies in the Columbia Intermontane Province within the Columbia plateau and on the eastern slope of the Cascade Mountains. The Cascade Mountains, Eastern Slope, is a transitional area between the Cascade Mountains to the west and the lower lying Columbia Basalt Plateau to the south and east. It has some of the landforms typical of both the mountains and plateau. The mountainous areas consist mainly of Pre-Cretaceous metamorphic rocks cut by younger igneous intrusives mantled with thick surficial deposits of Pleistocene aged drift and till deposits from the Okanogan Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet (USDA 2006, USDA 2008). Major landforms include terraces, moraines, foothills and mountains. Valley bottoms and riverine systems with their associated floodplains are dominated by quaternary alluvium.

Dominant soils within the burn area are well drained and have a xeric (dry) soil moisture regime and mesic (warm) and frigid soil temperature regimes. Mesic soils are present at lower elevations, and support shrub/steppe plant communities; where forested they occupy south and some west aspects and support Ponderosa pine/grass and shrub vegetation. Frigid, forested soils are on north and east aspects and support mixed conifer (Douglas fir and Ponderosa pine) and forb/shrub understory vegetation. Soils on the terraces, ground moraines, foothills and mountains consist of medium to very coarse textures of granitic colluvium and residuum and outwash and till derived from mixed sources; but dominantly granitic in origin. Thick deposits of till and outwash overlie bedrock composed of granite, schist and metasedimentary rock.  In areas where the till mantle has thinned; soils have developed in residuum and colluvium derived mainly from igneous (intrusive), metamorphic and some metasedimentary rock. The surface of the soils are influenced and mantled with volcanic ash from air fall events from various sources (dominantly from Mt. Mazama). Generally, the surface textures are medium and coarse and have moderate and high infiltration. Subsoil textures range from medium to very coarse and have moderate to very rapid permeability. In subsoils in which a dense layer is present, permeability is restricted. Surface and subsurface rock fragment content ranges from 0 to over 65 percent and range in size of gravel, cobbles and stones. Many areas within the burn area have rock outcrop, cobbles, stones and boulders on the soil surface. Soil depth ranges from less than 20 inches to greater than 60 inches to restrictive layers. Dominant restrictive layers are unweathered (hard) and weathered (soft) bedrock generally granitic in origin and dense (compacted), non-cemented subsoil layers formed in till parent materials. Dominant soils are Haploxerolls, Inceptisols and Andisols and are represented by the Conconully, Kartar and Parmenter soil series respectively. The erosion hazard within the fire perimeter varies by soil type. Their texture, structure, rock content, permeability, and slope are principle factors in their susceptibility to surface erosion. The following table displays the proportion of relative erosion hazard on the non-federal lands within the fire USDA 2008, USDA 2010).

Erosion rates were quantified further using an erosion prediction tool known as ERMiT that was developed by the Rocky Mountain Research branch of the Forest Service (Robichaud et al.  2006). Using the ERMiT model, overall erosion rates were estimated. These estimates are used for comparative purposes when applying for emergency funding. For non-federal lands, erosion rates were estimated to be:

Forest lands Average = 2.77 tons/acre, Maximum = 10.8 tons/acre

Rangelands Average = 3.08 tons/acre, Maximum = 7.8 tons/acre Soil Burn Severity: Fire effects to soil resources are often identified by Soil Burn Severity (SBS). There are typically 3 severity categories assessed, and their arrangement and distribution mapped within the wildfire perimeter. The categories identified on non-federal lands within the Carlton Fire that were observed can be defined as follows:

High soil burn severity: About 4% of the non-federal lands in the fire were determined to be in the high soil burn severity category. The canopy and understory were consumed and the litter layer was only partially consumed. The most severely burned slopes occur where pre-fire vegetation density and fuels accumulations were highest, within the Carlton fire these were typically on steep north-facing aspects and at the heads of watersheds. Even under these conditions, soil structure was intact and unconsumed fine roots were present within the upper 4 inches of the mineral soil surface.

Moderate soil burn severity: About 16% of the non-federal lands in the fire were determined to be in the moderate soil burn severity category. 

In range areas with moderate soil burn severity the vegetation was consumed. Soil structure was intact and unconsumed fine roots were present within the upper 4 inches of the mineral soil surface.

Low soil burn severity: The majority (70%) of Forest and rangeland soils were determined to be in the low soil burn severity category. These burned over soils exhibited good surface structure, contain intact fine roots and organic matter, partially intact litter and duff layers, and are already exhibiting recovery as grasses and forbes are visibly sprouting. 

One factor evaluated in an effort to define the extent of high soil burn severity was water repellency, or a measure of soil hydrophobicity. 

Slight to moderate soil hydrophobicity (water repellency) occurred in both moderate and high soil burn severity under both forest and rangeland. Strong (persistent) water repellency was observed in some moderate and high soil burn severities. 

Where observed, the water repellent layer generally occurred at the soil surface directly below the ash layer and partially consumed litter layer within 0.5 to 1.0 inch from the soil surface. Water repellent surfaces were also observed in some unburned areas. The majority of field observations indicated weak (low) repellency at the soil surface and to depths of 4 inches. Based on data collected in the field, the following was used to develop the following ratings:

High SBS areas averaged 20 percent strong water repellency.

Moderate SBS areas averaged 10 percent moderate water repellency.

Low SBS areas and unburned areas had 2.5 percent water repellency. Water-repellent soils (weak, moderate, and strong repellency combined) are estimated to comprise about 8,075 acres of the total non-federal burned areas. They are mostly located on the steep upper slopes of the Benson, Chiliwist, Cow, Finley, Frazier, French, Whitestone drainages. Reduction in infiltration is estimated to be 2- 7 % of observed samples in the moderate and high soil burn severity burn areas. Infiltration was not reduced in the low burn severity areas, which characterizes the majority of the non-federal lands in the Carlton fire. Potential Physical, Chemical and Biological Fire Effects on Soil Resources:

Fire effects on soil productivity range from beneficial to damaging, depending on fire severity, soil type, and site history (Neary et al, 2005).  Adverse fire effects increase as burn severity increases and the effects are often proportional to the amount of surface litter and soil organic matter consumed.  The sensitivity of soils to fire effects is influenced by soil texture, soil moisture, organic matter content, rock content, soil depth, depth of surface layer and erosion potential.  Important and sensitive soil layers include soils formed under range vegetation and Ponderosa/grass & shrub sites have soils with thicker, humified layers compared to the soils formed under a mixed conifer vegetation type. Pre-fire soils in forested areas have important thick litter and duff layers protecting the mineral soil surface. Soils with a thick volcanic ash mantle have properties and qualities that are important for soil productivity. Loss of these layers due to erosion can reduce soil productivity and can contribute to sedimentation.

Physical Effects:

Loss of litter layer, soil and soil organic matter

Loss of soil structure

Hydrophobicity (formation of water repellent layer)

In extreme cases, destruction of clay minerals Chemical Effects:

Increase in pH Loss of cation exchange capacity

Loss of nutrients by volatilization, in fly ash, or by leaching

Increase plant available N (ammonia) under low severity burns

Oxidation reactions from extremely severe burning can discolor the surface soil

Potential for increased release of heavy metals in contaminated soils Biological Effects:

Direct mortality of soil micro and macro organisms and loss of their habitat with soil heating

Burning of Duff, Litter, and Soils Severe Burning of the litter, duff and soil affects soil cover, infiltration, soil micro and macro organisms, and nutrients:

Loss of effective ground cover leaves soil susceptible to erosion especially in soils formed in decomposed granitic materials

Mortality of some soil organisms and combustion of surface soil organic matter

Volatilization or release and increased mobility of some soil nutrients

Debris movement and dry ravel may increase when small organic debris dams are burned out

Increased water repellent (hydrophobic) soil limits water infiltration.  Surface hydrophobicity significantly increases accelerated runoff and erosion.  Additionally, when a hydrophobic layer forms below a surface layer, the risk of the surface layer ﬁslicking offﬂ is increased.  Vegetation Within the fire there are two dominant cover types, forest and rangelands. 

The two types co-mingle across much of the area. 

Forest lands comprise about 35% of the non-federal lands and are made up of several conifer associations. The lower elevations are dominated by dry site Ponderosa pine plant communities with a bunchgrass/shrub understory. Mid-elevations are transition zones where Ponderosa pine and Douglas-fire plant communities are dominant. The upper-most elevations are comprised of dry site mixed conifer plant communities, which were comprised of various mixes of Ponderosa pine,

Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, and western larch depending on the aspect. 

About 5% of the forested cover types were considered to have been burned at a high intensity. Fire intensity on about 19% of the forest was considered to be moderately, and the remaining 76% was considered to be of low intensity. 

Rangelands comprise an estimated 65% of the no-federal lands in the fire. They can be characterized as shrub-steppe cover types dominated by blue-bunch wheatgrass and antelope bitterbrush plant communities. They transition into the forest cover types, extending upwards with elevation depending primarily on aspect. Reestablishment of the antelope bitterbrush on the shrub-steppe plant community will likely be prolonged where older stands were consumed. 

High-fire intensity occurred across about 2% of the rangelands. Moderate burn intensity covered an estimated 36%, and low intensity burn occurred across the remaining 62%. 

Another important cover type that occurs in the area is riparian stringers dominated by mature quaking aspen stands. 

Although there is no mapped inventory, they are crucial wildlife habitat, and many of these were burned over and mortality is nearly complete. 

Invasive Species The burn condition in the state and private lands varied in severity. The majority of the affected land for State and Private land was listed in the Moderately Burned Severity category totaling 75%, compared to 17% Light Burned Severity, and 8% High Burn Severity. The focus is to treat soils that are in the high and moderate burn severity where soil erosion may affect critical values, soil productivity, and invasion of noxious weeds and invasive species. High soil burn severity areas within the Carlton Fire areas are subject to spread of noxious weed communities and invasive species. Many of the noxious weed and invasive species have the potential to out compete native plant communities during post fire recovery. The treatments designed are to protect sensitive native plant communities and supplement remaining native seed banks that promote native plant community recovery and reduce the potential for invasion of noxious weeds into areas disturbed by fire suppression activities and in all burn severity areas.

In addition, the area receives frequent strong winds which are capable of spreading weed seeds, and high levels of use by the public who inadvertently act as vectors for noxious weed spread. Because of dozer lines, hand lines, roads, and previously infested areas the encompass approximately 256,108 acres of state, federal, and private land.  The newly burned soil is vulnerable to rapid establishment of noxious weeds and invasive, non-native plants. Add to this the presence of 152.6 miles of new dozer lines, (areas of soil disturbance), and 26.7 miles of hand lines, and it is clear that without prompt action, the potential for an explosion of invasive weeds on high and moderately burned soils, along with the dozer and hand lines is extremely high. The Washington State Noxious Weed List controlled by the State Weed Control Board.

It contains all of the Statewide Class A noxious weeds.

Class A weeds are of very limited distribution in Washington State and are in a category of mandatory eradication of the entire plant.

Class B weeds are more widespread, but need consideration and required control: means required to stop seed production.

Class C weeds are fairly widespread and not considered feasible to require eradication. However, it does not mean the species doesn™t warrant severe concern and eradication action at the local scale. Washington State Weed Board: http://www.nwcb.wa.gov/

Rangeland Resources The rangeland and grazeable woodland areas burned were mostly in shrub/bunchgrass (jointed species), mixed conifer/sod-forming grasses (non-jointed species) and aspen ecotypes. The intensity of the burn varied from low to high, forming a mosaic pattern with some areas unburned.  The high intensity burned areas showed complete mortality on conifer, aspen, shrubs and all grass and forb species.  The moderate burn killed most of the conifer, aspen and shrubs while leaving some plant crowns of the grasses alive.  Much of the low burn intensity areas occurred in rangeland and open canopy woodlands with a shrub and grass/forb vegetative component. Brush stubs remained and live root crowns were of grasses and some forbs were observable.  After two rainfall events in August, green up was observed at many sites, with bunchgrass sprigs growing from burned crowns. This is very promising for plant survival, recovery and rehabilitation, and is an indicator of the inherent resilience of the rangelands that were burned over.

Ponderosa Pine/Bitterbrush Grazeable Woodland Pinus ponderosa/Purshia tridentata Mixed Conifer/Pinegrass Grazeable Woodland Mixed Conifer/Calamagrostis rubescens The fire burned over many miles of perimeter/boundary and interior fences of federal, state and private land. Much of it was destroyed or damaged beyond repair, so were many water developments. A comprehensive inventory of these developments has not been compiled. 

Findings and Recommendations The multi-agency BAER team underwent a comprehensive exercise to identify critical values at risk. Native or naturalized plant communities at risk of invasion by invasive or noxious weeds were identified as critical values where the magnitude of consequence is likely to be major. 

Soil productivity was also identified to be a resource likely to be at high risk. Treatments to address these values included both emergency measures and longer term actions. Longer term actions address critical soil values, however the magnitude of consequences to them is moderate and less likely. 

Treatments and rehabilitation actions were identified and developed using examples and guidance provided in the Burned Area Emergency Response Treatments Catalog (Napper.  2006). 

Digital copies can be located on the internet at: http://www.fs.fed.us/eng/pubs/pdf/BAERCAT/lo_res/06251801L.pdf Risks to Values The findings of the BAER team September 4 through September 10, 2014. Two major issues exist: (1) the potential for weeds to spread at a faster rate from existing infestations as a result of the fire, and (2) the risk of new invasive species introduction. These introductions could come from heavy equipment, vehicles, fire engines, base camps, firefighting crews. Areas of special concern are along dozer and hand lines.  In addition, post fire operations pose and additional seed source of noxious weeds.  There are a total of 152.6 miles of completed dozer lines and 26.7 hand lines.

The following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of irreversible damage to native vegetation from noxious weed and invasive species to spread in the burn area:

Conduct weed detection surveys to identify and remove newly discovered infestations adjacent to existing weed infestations.

Conduct weed detection surveys and remove newly discovered infestations along dozer & hand lines, and inside and around noted polygons of high and moderate burn severity areas that are designated for reseeding.

Treat areas with herbicides, mechanical practices.

Seed dozer lines with native seed to discourage repeated ground disturbance and further weed spread from ORV recreation/ activities. 

Map DR-4188 in the Appendix shows the locations of the dozer lines and other fire lines in relation to the burn area. As of September 10, 2014, there was a total of 152.6 miles of completed dozer lines. The dozer lines extend far beyond the final burn perimeter as they were built in anticipation of the fire spreading even further. All dozer lines should be considered contaminated with weed seeds. Location / (suitable) Sites:

The proposed treatments are designed for dozer and hand lines on state land (only) that were untreated, where noxious weed pressure is expected to be high on native plant communities. In addition, the BAER Team proposed sights to enhance soil productivity lessen soil loss down slope and lower possible future mass flow events in reaches that may affect critical values (personal property, and infrastructure) in or near proposed seeding sites. Design/ Construction Specifications:

Native seed mix is to be applied on dozer lines and identified polygons. Seeding to occur in areas identified by field survey, and severe burn severity and susceptible or known infestation areas. Use seed mix recommended by local seed company AgTech. Apply Aerial seed mix at a rate of 25 lbs/ac, hand/ broadcasting at a rate of 15 lbs/ac. using the ﬁNRCS Critical Area Planting Standards 342ﬂ as a guide. 

Seed mix is to be applied to dozer lines by hand or 4-wheeler where applicable. 

Seed mix will be applied to polygons identified by aerial application. 

Seeding should occur in late fall or early winter to allow seed to naturally stratify. 

Application can be broadcast or aerial dropped directly on snow surface.  Seed mix rate determined using NRCS Critical Area Planting Standards 342 as a guide and consult. 

Treatments include 47 acres of dozer lines and 2760 acres of identified polygons within the high burn severity areas. Areas in polygons are subject to high probability of noxious weed intrusion,  (See map for treatment locations)

Purpose of Treatment and Specifications Wildfire causes disturbance that provides a receptive opportunity for the spread of noxious weeds & invasive species. Noxious weeds and non native species introduction and spread are of concern in the Okanogan National Forest that can affect its™ natural biodiversity in the scrublands and forested lands. 

The potential for noxious weed invasion, competition, and modification of native plant communities exists.  Treatment is necessary to reduce the establishment and control the spread of noxious weeds and invasive species. Native communities in both the rangeland and forest land are susceptible the following: Diffused Knapweed, Dalmatian & Yellow Toadflax, Cheatgrass, Hounds tongue, Musk & Scotch Thistle, Mullen, and Leafy Spurge. Additional species listed in local area The BAER team recommends chemical treatment for spaying of noxious weeds & invasive species along with cultural treatments. A field survey is needed to determine sites along roadsides, when found and in and near selected polygons. Noxious weed and invasive plant treatments are often site-specific. They include mechanical, cultural, chemical or biological control methods.  The focus is not on eradication in this situation but control and management until native species come back.  The recommended treatments may lessen future infestations. More than one treatment method may enhance noxious weed control; one such approach is to use plant competition along with biological controls like Integrated Pest Management (IPM). This help to restoring disturbed sites to prevent weed reoccurrences and provide competition for the weeds is essential. Treatment Methods:

Chemical Mechanical

Biological Treatments Cultural Treatment Chemical Chemical spaying for noxious weeds and invasive plants is dependent on the size of infestations and site conditions. 

Mechanical Mechanical Control treatments help disrupt weed growth. Mechanical weed control is the oldest method used. Treatments often used are tillage, hoeing, hand pulling, cultivation, mulching, and mowing. Common Mechanical Tillage works by disturbing the root system by dislodging or cutting the root system resulting in desiccation of the plant. Tillage easily controls small weeds and most effective in hot, dry environments. 

Often repeat tillage when new shoots emerge (typically every two weeks). This can help to control weed growth but often take one or two growing seasons. 

Mowing is another treatment that reduces annual weed growth. Like tillage it must be performed numerous times. Mowing however will not prevent seed production as the plants tend flower again closer to the ground. This has been often noted with Spotted and Diffuse Knapweed. The knapweed plant will adjust to the level of the mower and go to seed. Biological Control Biological control is the use of living organisms to suppress weed populations to an acceptable level. The insects used are natural enemies of the targeted species that come from the weed's native ecosystem. 

The use of biological controls impacts its targeted species in two ways:

Direct Impact - destroys vital plant tissues and functions

Indirect Impact - increases stress on the targeted species to reduce the plants ability to compete with desirable plants. The use of bio-controls may take several years to become established in order to make an impact on the targeted species. Using multiple treatments like chemical spaying outside a known boundary along with IPM™s are often used to keep pests in a targeted area. 

Cultural Weed Control Cultural weed control treatments used with other treatments provide sound practices for land use in a variety of settings. The planting desirable vegetation, use of goats or livestock along with good grazing management are known methods of cultural weed control treatments. The planting of cereal grain crops, grasses, or in combinations that compete for sunlight, water, and soil nutrients with weeds. Rapid establishment is vital to success providing the best chance to resist noxious weed and intrusive species invasions. Disturbed sites, roadways, and fence lines are most susceptible and often where invasions occur first. Invasions start when seeds are brought in by vehicles, or when soil disturbance occurs from operations. 

Note:  not all treatments intended for noxious weed or invasive plant eradication. For more information consult Noxious Weed Control Board or local Cooperative Extension Agent in your area.

Rangeland Management to Protect Long-term soil productivity and grazing resources: All pastures will need a period of rest to allow for growth and establishment of forage species. There are areas within the fire perimeter that did not burn or very low intensity but due to the location of these areas it is felt best that they be rested also. There is a large unburned island of land, with multiple ownerships, surrounded by the fire but this is considered outside the fire perimeter. Livestock grazing should be managed on site specific, location by location basis depending upon unburned infrastructure and usability. 

After the second year of rest (2016), assessment and successful evaluation, grazing should be deferred till the end of soft dough stage following the critical period for bunchgrasses and could resume during dormant season of the third year (2017). Recommend following NRCS Range Technical Note 34, Grazing Management Guidelines, November 2009 for grazing guidelines and strategies. These standards should be monitored each year and documented to track progress toward meeting the desired conditions required to return livestock grazing.  If more site specific standards are developed for the individual pastures they will be monitored in the same manor to ensure they are being implemented. Variables to work with in Grazing Management:

Time/timing of grazing periods o Season of use (when) o Duration or length of grazing periods (how long)

Intensity of grazing (how much)  Œ utilization and residual

Frequency of grazing periods (how often)

Space/Area of landscape

Animal Numbers Œ stock density, class of livestock, wildlife

Rest/Recovery Periods Prescribed Grazing is managing the harvest of plants by grazing animals, both livestock and wildlife. 

Prescribed Grazing is very much a learning-tool:  Plan the grazing Œ Manage the grazing Œ Monitor and evaluate the results Œ Adjust the grazing plan (adaptive management). To manage land and natural resources effectively, it is recommended to measure the changes that occur, evaluate the results, and revise activities, as needed, to move toward desired outcomes.  If you don™t measure carefully, you can™t manage effectively.  What to monitor depends upon resources available, goals and objectives, and action items set out in the conservation plan. Long-Term/Effectiveness Monitoring and Short-Term Monitoring: A combination of short-term and long-term monitoring should be utilized whenever possible. Long-term monitoring focused on the objectives is used to generate a ﬁtrend recordﬂ while short-term monitoring is used to establish an ﬁannual-use recordﬂ keeping track of the management applied each year and the effects of that management.  A representative key area of each vegetative type/key species burned in the fire should be chosen. An appropriate assessment for these communities should be conducted in the second year and then yearly until normal grazing can be resumed. Designated monitoring areas (DMA) in riparian zones should be established to measure the impacts of the fire on vegetative communities and monitor the condition and health of streams. The burned area, now lacking desired vegetation that would normally compete with noxious weeds, is vulnerable to expansion existing noxious weed sources and other invasive species (e.g., Cheatgrass). 

Even in the low intensity burned areas, it will still take at least one growing season (Summer 2015) until native vegetation can reestablish and compete with existing unburned noxious weed populations. 

Noxious weed monitoring should be conducted annually, to include known infestations and to record new species that may have been introduced during suppression and rehab.  This will target areas within and adjacent to the burned areas.  Treatments will be conducted to reduce or prevent further spread of invasive and noxious weed species. All Dozer and Hand lines within the burn area will be seeded by hand and then monitored to document recovery needs. After a discussion with forest and district specialist it was decided that the standards for rehabilitation was applicable to the entire fire area and the entire area should be rested for the required two years. 

Where wildfire has burned within an allotment, burned areas should be evaluated to determine if rest from livestock grazing is necessary for recovery of desired vegetation conditions and related biophysical resources. 

When sagebrush cover types are determined to need rest from livestock grazing following a wildfire, areas should be rested for a minimum of two growing seasons. Evaluate whether additional rest is needed after two growing seasons. Base this determination on the following factors:  a) The ecological status of the sagebrush community prior to the wildfire, b) How Long the shrub steppe community had a density or canopy closure greater than15 percent prior to the wildfire, c) The severity and intensity of the fire, d) The amount, diversity and recovery of forbs, grasses and palatable shrubs that are present after 2 years of rest in relation to desired conditions. 

The dominate communities within the rangelands are bitterbrush/sagebrush/bunchgrass. In areas other than shrub steppe cover types, such as ponderosa pine/ mixed conifer/pinegrass and aspen communities appropriate rest period should be determined. Base this determination on the following factors: Soil conditions, the amount, diversity and recovery of forbs, grasses and palatable shrubs that are present after 2 years of rest. Pasture infrastructure that was damaged or destroyed in the fire will need to be repaired to implement grazing management strategies. Many miles of fencing will have to be replaced and salvage of damaged fence material recovered. A high percentage of fencing along pasture boundaries of the burn area will need prompt replacement to keep livestock from trespassing onto the burned area, and before residual grazing strategies can resume. It is very important to re-establish control of livestock and carrying capacity at an optimum, sustainable level to provide a proper recovery timeframe. Replacement of interior fence will be very important for the maintenance and recovery of rangeland quality, production, and habitat conservation.   References Napper, Carolyn.  2006.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Carlton Complex Fire affected three ESA-listed fish stocks in the Methow and Okanogan subbasins as well as several non-listed game fish, non-game fish and forage fish species.  This report focuses on the acute fire effects and post-fire long-term effects predicted for the ESA-listed stocks and important recreational game fishes.

The Methow River supports runs of Upper Columbia River (UCR) spring Chinook salmon (endangered), Upper Columbia River summer Steelhead (threatened) and Columbia River Bull Trout (threatened) and their designated ﬁCritical Habitat.ﬂ

Other species of interest include Coho salmon, summer Chinook, cutthroat, red band/rainbow, and Pacific lamprey. 

The Okanogan River supports populations of UCR steelhead (threatened) and their critical habitat as well as sockeye salmon, and summer Chinook salmon. 

The extent to which wildfires impact streams is a function of burn severity, fire intensity, burn area, topography, soil properties, climate, and channel proximity.  Wildfire can reduce soil infiltration capacity and increase runoff and erosion.  Based on field observations completed during this BAER assessment, many of the high and moderate severity burns have a high potential for surface erosion from overland flow that may enter headwater channels causing sediment bulking that can be transported during subsequent high flow events.

Potential post-fire effects include: increased water temperature, peak flows and channel scour, surface erosion and fine sediment delivery, and landslides and debris flows. 

Fire effects to fish and habitat are expected to be the greatest in the next few years and to diminish to pre-fire levels within 7 to 10 years.  Some of the effects such as increased large wood inputs, fresh bedload and gravel could positively affect aquatic habitat. 

With the exception of Beaver Creek, fish bearing tributaries in the Carlton Complex did not suffer a large percentage of moderate to high burn severity. 

Sediment from post fire effects will likely affect ESA listed fish migrating through the lower Methow River as a result of sediment delivery from steep non-fishing bearing streams. 

Delivery of fine sediment from debris flows to the Methow and Okanogan Rivers from the Carlton Complex has already occurred. 

The greatest impact of this will be to spawning areas in Beaver Creek and the mainstem lower

Methow. 

Additional sediment delivery events within 1-3 years are likely. Roughly 15.5% of riparian area along Beaver Creek burned, which will likely increase summer low-flow stream temperatures and diurnal temperature fluctuation.

Burned Area Emergency Response treatments that reduce fine sediment delivery, restore natural drainage patterns and allow for large wood movement and or accumulation in fish bearing streams and the mainstem Methow are expected to benefit ESA listed spring Chinook, steelhead and bull trout. I. OBJECTIVES Identify fisheries values at risk

Assess how overall changes to soil and watershed function caused by the fire that may affect critical fisheries values

Recommend non-emergency treatments to reduce the risk to fisheries values

Identify possible long term treatments to aid habitat recovery and reduce impacts of future events.   II. ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY Information for this assessment is based on a review of relevant literature, habitat and other field inventory information, and post-fire reconnaissance completed on September 5-9, 2014. 

Species occurrence is based on surveys conducted prior to the Carlton Complex Fire. III. CRITICAL FISHERIES VALUES AT RISK Carlton Complex burned 256,108 acres within the Methow River subbasin (HUC 5) and the Okanogan River subbasin (HUC 5). 

Anadromous fish bearing waters within the fire perimeter include the Lower Methow River, Bear Creek, Beaver Creek, Libby Creek, Gold Creek, Black Canyon Creek, the Okanogan River, and Loup Loup Creek. 

The lower Methow River, from rivermile (RM) 34 to the confluence with the Columbia River is within the area of affect by the fire.  It is also going to be susceptible to longterm post fire affects from debris flows and sediment input from seasonal and perennial tributaries adjacent burned slopes.

This reach of the Methow River is used by ESA threatened Upper Columbia River steelhead and summer Chinook (not ESA listed) for pre-spawn holding, spawning, juvenile rearing and migration.  This area is also a critical migration corridor for spring Chinook as adults migrate to the upper watershed for spawning and juveniles outmigrate to the Columbia River and Ocean.  ESA listed threatened Bull Trout use the lower mainstem Methow for rearing, foraging and migration.  Their entire spawning habitat is located outside of areas affected by the fire. Pacific Lamprey rely on the lower Methow River for rearing and migration.  Specific impacts to Pacific Lamprey are difficult to predict because population dynamics and distribution with the subbasins is relatively unknown. 

The Okanogan River is designated critical habitat for UCR steelhead, which primarily use it as a migration corridor with Summer Chinook and Sockeye.  The mainstem Okanogan River exceeds suitable temperatures for most salmonids during low flow summer months.  This favors ocean-type life history strategies and has contributed greatly to the extirpation of viable spring Chinook populations within this basin.   Figure 1. Illustrates the ESA-listed Fish Distribution within the area of fire effect.  Upper Columbia spring Chinook, Upper Columbia Summer Steelhead and Columbia River Bull Trout are present in the Methow Subbasin.  Only Columbia River Steelhead are present in the Okanogan Subbasin. IV. 

FISH SPECIES & GENERAL LIFE HISTORIES  a. Upper Columbia spring Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)

Species Legal Status: ESA-Listed Endangered General Life History: Spring Chinook adults begin returning from the ocean to the Methow subbasin from April through July.  These fish commonly hold in freshwater tributaries until spawning occurs in the late summer, peaking in mid to late August.  Juvenile spring Chinook emerge from redds in gravel substrate in February and March.  After one year of rearing in freshwater (stream-type) the fry begin to change into smolts as they prepare to migrate to the ocean during spring of their second year of life.  Most Upper Columbia spring

Chinook return as adults after two or three years in the ocean (Figure 3). 

The majority of spring Chinook spawning in the Methow subbasin occurs upstream of the area affected by the Carlton Complex fire. Most adult spawners should have been upstream of the area affected by the fire directly and the ash and debris flows which occurred in August. 

Spawning is concentrated in the mainstem upper Methow River and its largest tributaries: the Chewuch River and Twisp River.  Occasional spawning may occur in Gold Creek and at the smaller tributary confluences with the Methow River.  Spawning in these areas should considered rare occurrences, constituting approximately .1% of the basin wide spawning annually.

Spring Chinook do not currently spawn or rear in the Okanogan River. 

The spring Chinook  life stages and habitats most likely to be impacted  by the immediate fire effects and subsequent increased fine and coarse sediment loading will be juvenile and adult migration habitat and juvenile rearing habitat in the lower mainstem of the Methow River and fire affected tributaries.  These acute effects could last for 1 to 3 years. 

Spring Chinook spawning habitat is generally not found in the fire affected area.  Positive effects from the fire include habitat benefits from increased in stream wood, bedload, and gravel recruitment.   b. Columbia River Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss)

Species Legal Status: ESA-listed Threatened General Life History: Adult steelhead return to the Columbia River in the late summer and early fall then often hold for long periods of time in mainstem Columbia reservoirs or low in tributaries like the Methow until they move to spawning areas  in April and May the following year.  Spawning typically occurs in the late spring.  Depending on water temperature, eggs will incubate in the gravel for around 30 days. Fry emerge in June through July depending on water temperatures and spawning dates.  Juvenile steelhead generally spend one to three years rearing in freshwater before migrating to the ocean,  but have been documented spending as many as seven years in freshwater before out-migrating (Figure 3).

Steelhead are generally classified as stream-type species which rear in the freshwater for a year or longer, making fish in the lower mainstem susceptible to stress from increased turbidity and fine sediment in the river.  It is assumed that dramatic increases in fine sediment, without associated coarse organic and inorganic material, will negatively impact juvenile and adult migration and juvenile rearing habitat.  However impacts from fine sediment delivery will largely be dependent on the magnitude, timing and duration of runoff events.  Dramatic increases in turbidity will likely be short duration with diminishing return through successive years of spring runoff and recovery.

Increases in large wood, and gravel and rock could provide favorable habitat for adult and juvenile steelhead. 

Figure 2.  Spawning ground survey data from 2005 through 2012 illustrates the average annual percentage of steelhead redds for the Methow subbasin that are in the fire affected area.  Sediment impacts to spawning habitat are predicted to be the greatest in Beaver Creek and the mainstem Lower Methow River.

On average 5% of the basinwide spawning occurs in Beaver Creek and 12% in the lower mainstem Methow River.  Within the fire affected area in the Okanogan subbasin only Loup Loup Creek contains spawning UCR Steelhead. c. Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus)

Species Legal Status: ESA-listed threatened General Life History: Bull trout in the Upper Columbia basin exhibit both resident and migratory life-history strategies; resident bull trout complete their entire life cycle in their natal stream, on the other hand migratory bull trout migrate to larger systems to rear.  Bull trout typically spawn in the fall in cold, clean, low gradient headwater streams with loose clean gravel. 

Throughout all life stages, bull trout are found in streams where water temperatures remain below 15°C and have complex forms of cover including large woody debris, undercut banks, boulders and pools. Migratory bull trout spawn in tributary streams where juvenile fish rear one to four years before migrating to either a lake (adfluvial form) or larger river (fluvial form).  Migrating bull trout have been observed within spawning tributaries as early as the end of June, spawning occurs in mid-September to late October (Figure 3). 

There are no documented bull trout spawning areas in the Carlton Complex affected area.  Bull trout have not been found in the Okanogan watershed, although historically they may have occurred there.  The mainstem Methow is a migratory corridor for bull trout and is used by large migratory bull trout as foraging habitat for much of the year. 

Adult bull trout are piscivorous and are found in the fire affected reaches of the mainstem Methow for much of the year.  Beaver Creek is the only tributary in the Carlton Complex that has documented resident bull trout, although they have not been observed there for several years. 

Bull trout are susceptible to competition and interbreeding with other non-native char species such as brook trout.

Figure 3.  Illustrates the life stage and timing within the fire effected tributaries and Lower Methow River.  Timing of runoff events and increased sediment loading have the potential to affect different life stages ESA populations.  Note that spring Chinook and Bull Trout spawn upstream of the area affected by the Carlton Complex Fire. d. Pacific Lamprey (Lampetra tridentate) Species Legal Status: Species of Concern General Life History: After spending one to three years in the marine environment Pacific lampreys cease feeding and migrate to freshwater between February and June.  They are thought to overwinter and remain in freshwater habitats for up to one year prior to spawning.  Their preferred spawning habitat is similar to salmon; in freestone gravel bottomed streams, at the upstream end of riffle habitat typically above suitable larvae rearing habitat.  Spawning occurs March through July depending upon location within the range.  Ammocoetes drift downstream to areas of low velocity and fine substrates where they burrow, grow and live as filter feeders for 2 to 7 years and feed primarily on algae.

Several generations and age classes of ammocoetes congregate in high densities that form colonies.  Ammocoetes are relatively immobile.  Metamorphosis to macropthlamia (juvenile phase) occurs gradually as they develop eyes, teeth and become free swimming.  Outmigration of juveniles to the Pacific Ocean occurs between late fall and early spring.  Lamprey ammocoetes are found in fine sediments along the mainstem Methow River within the area affected by the Carlton Complex fire.  Distribution in the Okanogan River is unknown.  e. Other Affected Fish Species The post fire effects from the Carlton Complex fire have the potential to affect other important recreational fisheries, forage fish and non-game fish species. 

Beginning in 1997 the Yakama Nation began a Coho reintroduction program in the Methow subbasin.  Coho were extirpated from the Methow River and its tributaries in the mid-20th century after an impassible dam was constructed near the confluence with the Columbia River.  Coho tend to be tributary spawners that are commonly found in Gold Creek, Libby Creek,

Beaver Creek and side channels of the mainstem Methow.

Coho have been extirpated from the Okanogan subbasin.

Summer Chinook spawn throughout the mainstem Methow and Okanogan subbasins.  Unlike their close relative, the spring Chinook, summers exhibit an ocean-type life history pattern, out migrating to the ocean during the first year of life.  They are not considered at risk of extinction in the near future.  Summer Chinook adult holding areas and spawning areas are found in reaches of the mainstem Methow affected by the fire and adult summer Chinook were likely impacted by the mid-August 2014 ash and debris flows. 

The Okanogan River provides a critical migration corridor for Sockeye returning to the Canadian Okanagan lakes.  Due to cooperative intergovernmental and public utility water management agreements the Sockeye runs have supported sufficient natural origin progeny to warrant robust commercial and recreation fisheries.  These fish exhibit an ocean-type life history and spawning habitat is located upstream of the burn area therefore overall impacts to the population are expected to be minimal. Native Westslope Cutthroat and rainbow trout are found throughout the mainstem Methow River and the almost all tributaries.  Fire effects to these species/races will  be similar to those that will be experienced by steelhead. 

Eastern book trout are a non-native species which was planted extensively in small streams and lakes for recreational fisheries on National Forest, state and private lands.  They have been shown to compete vigorously with native resident salmonid populations for space and forage year-round.  Additionally, they pose a significant threat to Bull Trout through interbreeding

Figure 1.  this illustration depicts ESA-listed fish use within the Carlton Complex Fire affected watersheds. V. 

FIRE AFFECTED WATERSHEDS AND SUB-WASTERSHED DESCRIPTIONS   a. Lower Methow River   The Methow River drains nearly 1,890 square miles (1,152,000 acres) and flows southward for more than 80 miles through western Okanogan County before emptying into the Columbia River near the town of Pateros.  About 89% of the subbasin in public ownership: U.S. Forest Service, WDFW, DNR and BLM. The remaining 11% is privately owned and is predominately situated in the valley bottoms.

About 12.8% of the Methow Subbasin burned in the Carlton Complex Fire.  Even more was consumed in the Falls Creek Fire and the Little Bridge Creek Fires of 2014.

The ladder two fires burned entirely on USFS property, therefore are outside the scope of analysis for this report.  In the Carlton Complex Fire about 4% of the Methow subbasin was burned at moderate to high fire severity (Table 2). 

The Methow River has been impacted by post fire ash and debris flows that occurred following high intensity rain fall over the burned area.  Beaver Creek, Frazier Creek, Benson Creek, Canyon Creek, Leecher Creek, French Creek and Cow creek all delivered massive quantities of fine sediment to the main stem Methow and will continue to do so for several years.

Following the debris flows the water was extremely turbid from about RM 34 to the mouth and into the Columbia River. The debris flows also delivered flotsam from damaged houses, vehicles, and shops in the form of fuel tanks, pressure tanks etc.  Following the debris flows over 7,000 lbs. of this flotsam has been removed from the Methow by volunteers.  There will be a continued need for this type of debris removal from the river. 

At the time of the flooding adult summer Chinook were holding in the mainstem river and were likely impacted by the increased fine sediment load. Pacific lamprey ammocoetes rear in fine sediments along the channel margins of mainstem Methow and were likely impacted by deposition of fine sediments.

The Bureau of Reclamation received anecdotal reports of dead suckers and salmon near the Leecher Creek debris fan following the flooding.

High fine sediment loads could affect steelhead spawning success in the spring of 2015.   b. Bear Creek The Bear Creek sub-watershed is 11,547 acres; 50% of the sub-watershed burned with about 13% of the burn being moderate to high severity (Table 2).

Bear Creek enters the east bank of the Methow River around RM 47. The lower 2.9 miles of the creek flow through private residential and agricultural lands.  The upper reaches are on WDFW and USFS lands. Juvenile spring Chinook salmon and juvenile steelhead/rainbow trout have access to the lower 0.18 mile of the creek where they encounter the first of a number of culvert barriers.

Upstream passage is blocked by low flows from irrigation diversions and by barriers created by 2 irrigation canal crossings and multiple road crossings.  Non-native brook trout are found above barrier road crossings in the upper reaches. The fire burned in the headwaters of Bear Creek with low to moderate intensity about 4 miles upstream of the confluence with the Methow.  Noticeable effects to fish habitat from the fire are not expected.   c. Beaver Creek Beaver Creek sub-watershed is 70,932 acres in size and enters the mainstem Methow at RM 34.  The watershed was 42% burned by the fire and 12% of the fire is moderate to high fire severity (Table 2).  Most of the moderate and high severity burned area is in Frazer Creek, a tributary to lower Beaver Creek.

The lower 6 miles of Beaver Creek flow through private lands that are used mainly for growing irrigated alfalfa, mixed hay and for livestock production. 

Debris flows from Frazer Creek have dramatically impacted the lower 2 miles of Beaver Creek. 

Dead rainbow/steelhead trout and sculpin were observed immediately following the fire and again following ash and debris flows created by convective storms in mid-August.

Juvenile Spring Chinook salmon can be found in low numbers in the lower 2 miles of Beaver Creek.  Steelhead spawn and rear on the lower 8 miles of Beaver Creek. Bull trout are found in extremely low numbers in the upper watershed and are at high risk of extirpation from the watershed. Brook trout populations in the upper watershed are robust and present a major threat to bull trout populations in Beaver Creek.  Re-introduced coho salmon also are beginning to recolonize lower Beaver Creek.

Forty percent of riparian areas in Beaver Creek burned in the fire; 16% of the riparian burn was moderate to high severity.  Prior to the fire, warm summer water temperatures were an issue in lower Beaver Creek.  This loss of riparian shade will likely increase water temperatures until vegetation regrows to provide shade.  Riparian areas are already re-sprouting vigorously and are expected to recover quickly.  The extent of riparian area burned in Beaver Creek is one of the larger Carlton Complex fire effects to fish (Table 1 and Table 2). 

In the last 10 years salmon and steelhead recovery efforts have been applied extensively to Beaver Creek to improve instream flows, re-establish fish passage at roads and irrigation diversions, improve habitat complexity, protect riparian areas, aquire conservation easements and restore beaver populations.  These projects appear to be functioning well, providing favorable channel bedform and complexity habitats.  The Old Schoolhouse Fish Habitat Enhancement Project was complete by the Yakama Nation™s Upper Columbia Habitat Restoration Project in 2013.  This project consisted of 12 engineered log structures, channel realignment and development of a spring fed side channel.  All work elements associated with this project survived the Carlton Complex Fire on July 17 and the Debris flows which occurred on August 13, 2014.  The large wood structures racked transient debris, increased floodplain inundation and efficiently attenuated the streams energy. 

The Upper Beaver Creek Fish Habitat Project was also completed in 2013 by the Methow Salmon Recovery Foundation.  It consists of a channel realignment, large wood habitat features and irrigation headgate improvement at the Batie Diversion.  The project area was burned over, but burn intensities were low in proximity to this project and survived well.  Sediment sluicing structures installed in the diversion are working well.

The piped canal is currently turned off due to fire damage directly to the pipe.  Damage to the diversion structure appears to be minimal, though we expect continued maintenance to be required while increased sand and fine particulate sediment delivery persists.  d. Frazer Creek Frazer Creek enters Beaver Creek 2.7 miles above the confluence with the Methow River.  Juvenile steelhead likely use the lowest stream segment of Frazer Creek for rearing. 

Upstream fish passage is blocked at the first irrigation diversion 0.3 miles upstream of the Beaver Creek confluence.  Above this, many private driveways seasonally interrupt fish passage.  Brook trout were found in the middle reaches of Frazier Creek prior to the debris flows in mid-August.  It is unknown if there is a seed source for Brook Trout in the unaffected upper subwatershed.  Several anthropogenic features significantly impair ecological function in Frazer Creek.  Washington State Highway 20 and utilities constrict much of its historic floodplain.  Due to channel aggradation the road surface elevation is currently at or below the low flow water elevation.  This is causing the highway cut bank to capture all of Frazer Creek™s water and channel it down the roadway.  Residential homes, barns and outbuildings also occupy portions of the lower three miles of floodplain.  Additionally there are several culverts and bridges which lock the channel in place and require debris removal from the stream to function properly.  e. Benson Creek Benson Creek is a 24,266 acre watershed that enters the Methow River at RM 32.5.  About 36% of the watershed was burned and 44% of the burn area was moderate to high severity (Table 2).

Due to topographic and hydrologic conditions there is no anadromous fish use in Benson Creek.  Benson Creek flows through upper Finley Canyon and into a series of reservoirs which were stocked with Brown trout (Salmo trutta), a non-native piscivorous salmonid species.  Two of these reservoirs breached and two more were damaged during the mid-August storms, causing massive amounts of water and debris to reach the Methow River.  If the adfluvial non-native fish made it to the Methow they should be eradicated as expeditiously as possible.  Further research and monitoring should be conducted to assess the likelihood of

Brown Trout survival.   f. 

Black Canyon Creek:

Black Canyon Creek joins the Methow River at RM 8.1 and has a drainage area of 15,856 acres; 35.2% of the watershed burned and 9% of the burn was at moderate to severe intensity (Table 2).  UCR steelhead spawn in the lower 0.4 miles of Black Canyon Creek.  Black Canyon Creek has an impassable falls at RM 3.5.  Due to the small amount of the watershed that burned at increased intensities we do not expect much impact to resident or anadromous fish species.  g. Squaw Creek Squaw Creek is 10,169 acres in size.  Approximately 44% burned and 14.2% was moderate to high severity burn (Table 2). 

A steep gradient confluence with the Methow blocks fish access. 

There is a private fish hatchery at creek mile 3.  This hatchery will be very susceptible to debris flows and flooding until ground cover recovers.  Efforts should be made to decrease the chance of accidental release to the Methow River.  The creek is known to have some native and non-native Brook Trout upstream of the hatchery.    h. Gold Creek The Gold Creek drainage is 56,881 acres and 12% was burned Œ 2.3%  burned at medium to high severity (Table 2). Gold Creek enters the Methow River from the east at RM 21.8.  Much of the drainage has been managed for timber harvest, livestock grazing and recreation (USFS 1996b).  The lower reaches of the mainstem and South Fork Gold Creek are privately owned. 

Roads parallel the major streams in the drainage and affect aquatic habitat (USFS 2000f). 

Steelhead, spring Chinook and bull trout spawn in the watershed.  We do not anticipate significant post-fire impacts to these fish due to the small percentage of the sub-watershed that burned at increased intensities.  i. Libby Creek:

The Libby Creek drainage contains 25,866 acres Œ 2.4% of the watershed burned and 2.3% of the burn is at moderate to high severity (Table 2).  Libby Creek enters the Methow River at RM__.  UCR steelhead and resident populations of cutthroat and rainbow trout inhabit the Lower 6 miles of Libby Creek. 

We do not anticipate significant post-fire impacts to these fish due to the small percentage of the sub-watershed that burned with high severity/intensity.  j. Okanogan River The Okanogan River is approximately 115 mi long and originates in southern British Columbia. 

Listed fish and fish species of concern in the U.S. portion of Okanogan River include UCR steelhead, summer Chinook salmon and sockeye salmon.

The lower reach that was affected by the fire is used as a migration corridor for the salmonid species. 

Loup Loup Creek provides the only suitable spawning habitat in the fire affected reach of the Okanogan watershed.  Pre-fire ecological concerns for fire affected area include elevated stream temperatures, increased fine sediment loads, and reduced habitat complexity (UCSRB RTT Revised Biological Strategy, 2014) The greatest impact to the Okanogan River will be predicted increased sediment input from Chilliwist Creek.  Chilliwist Creek is 26,594 acres; 64% of the watershed burned and 25% burned at moderate to high intensity (Table 2).  Following the fire high intensity rain storms caused debris flows and mud to flow down the creek and towards the Okanogan River.  Most of woody debris, cobbles and gravels settled out on the large alluvial fan, however increased surface flows contributed significant fine sediment to the Okanogan River.  Overall fire and post-fire impacts to UCR steelhead habitat in the Okanogan river are expected to be minimal.   k. Loup Loup Creek:

Loup Loup Creek is 14,597 acres; 31.7% of the watershed burned and 4.1 % of the burn was moderate to high severity (Table 2).  UCR steelhead are the only listed species that are found in Loup Loup Creek. They are recolonizing the creek in response to two culvert barriers near the mouth that were replaced with a bridge in 2012. The main ecological concerns for Loup Loup creek are reduced stream flow, high sediment loads, reduced habitat complexity and reduced riparian condition.  Some habitat impairments will be alleviated by increased wood and bedload recruitment predicted as post fire affects. While 31.7% of the Loup Loup watershed burned only 4.1% of Loup Loup Creek burned at moderate to high severity.  Adverse effects to habitat in Loup Loup Creek are expected to be minimal.

Table 1.  This table illustrates the relative size of each watershed or subwatershed and the relative amount of burned area and increased burn soil severity related to moderate and high burn intensities.  This can be used to generally predict the basins response to storm events and it capacity to buffer cumulative effects downstream.  It should be noted that the US portion of the Okanogan River Sub-basin is about 1,600,000 acres in size. 

VI. 

POST FIRE AFFECTS   a. Riparian Shade and stream temperature:

Increased stream temperatures can occur following wildfires when riparian vegetation is reduced in moderate and high intensity burns.  This can result in increased solar radiation and changes in streamside microclimates until enough riparian vegetation can again shade stream channels (Brown and Krieger 1970; Dwire and Kauffman 2003).  Changes in water temperatures can be especially problematic during the summer, when solar radiation levels are highest and streamflows are low (Beschta et al. 1987).  To evaluate potential changes in to water temperature we looked at the percent of riparian corridor which burned with moderate to high severity.  Using ArcGIS with the NHD streams layer and the corrected soil burn severity map we calculated the percent of riparian vegetation burned at varying intensities and percent of total perennial stream length by subwateshed.  .  The Beaver Creek sub-watershed (inclusive of Frazer Creek drainage) experienced the greatest loss of riparian vegetation cover.  Approximately 41% of the 36 mile long riparian drainage network burned with about 16% of that burning at moderate to high severity (Table 3).  Other fish bearing waters within the Methow and Okanogan subbasins did not experience significant riparian vegetation loss.

The greatest differences between reference and burned sites occurred during low flow in July and August. Even after seven years, maximum stream temperatures had not returned to pre-fire conditions. This suggests that until enough riparian vegetation recovers in the Beaver Creek drainage the stream will be susceptible to increased solar radiation and warmer low flow summer water temperatures. 

Table 2.  Describes the post-fire riparian conditions of anadromous fish-bearing streams in the Methow and Okanogan Subbasins. 

Figure 4.  Example of moderate burn severity in riparian area in Beaver Creek.    b. Stream Nutrients Increased nutrients (nitrogen, ammonium, and potassium) have likely eroded into streams as lighter ash washed from banks and adjacent burned slopes after initial rains in August 2014. Nutrient loading typically increases following a wildfire due to the rapid mineralization and dispersion of plant nutrients.  Increased nutrients may have a short-term positive benefit to Stream Length (Miles)

Surface Runoff and Erosion The extent to which wildfires impact streams is a function of burn severity, fire intensity, burn area, topography, soil properties, climate, and channel proximity (Baker, 1988; Beschta, 1990; DeBano et al., 1998; Robichaud, 2000).  Wildfires can reduce soil infiltration capacity and increase runoff and erosion.  Based on field transects completed during this

BAER assessment, many burn areas of the high and moderate severity experienced increases in soil hydrophobicity and potential for surface erosion, mass wasting and debris flows.  Absent of significant water accumulation adjacent hill slopes will be susceptible to dry ravel due to extreme topography and loose aggregations of material.

Because of this we anticipate accelerated soil erosion and sediment delivery in localized areas until enough vegetation recovers to stabilize source slopes; likely with 2 to 5 years.  These effects are especially likely in Beaver Creek, Frazer Creek, Upper Finley Canyon, Benson Creek, Texas, Cow, and Chiliwist Creek, which sustained large areas of moderate to high fire severity. 

Downed wood and course material in upslope areas and small depressions will reduce the erosive energy though significant events are will easily overwhelm roughness and storage capacities.  Many severely burned areas exhibit steep, headwall and upper watershed gorge topography which will efficiently transport material directly to valley bottoms, tributaries and mainstem systems.

Some streams with adequate roughness features may be able to temporarily store some fine sediment. 

However many streams experience chronically confined channels which efficiently !"#$%&'()'*$+,&%-'!."+$%&'!"#$%&'/)''012'.34'5&4"6&3-'!+781'"3'9&.,&%''transport material to lower gradient response reaches where it will likely settle out of suspension.  Spawning gravel quality may decrease in localized areas depending the magnitude and duration of the sediment pulse that enters the channel and the streams storage ability.  Pool volume may also decrease until sustained high flows re-scour pools and transport the fine sediment downstream.

Localized inchannel sediment may increase for several years as streamside trees fall and streambanks erode as flows move around fallen debris. Zelt and Wohl (2004) found stream channel width increased in burned streams due to increased bank erosion and sediment movement, which often causes stream bed agradation in response reaches.

The principal post fire impact to fisheries resources is projected to be fine sediment transport and deposition in the anadromous fish bearing tributaries and Lower Methow River. 

The contribution of surface runoff to fine sediment transport and deposition is highly dependent on storm variables such as location, timing, magnitude, and duration; as well as the watersheds capacity to store water and sediment. 

The Methow River™s large volume and capacity for sediment will attenuate the sediment impacts from ephemeral and perennial streams.  Beaver Creek and Frazier Creek however are likely to experience significant short term changes in sediment and hydrologic condition. i. Road and Fireline Contribution Road concentrations within the Carlton Complex fire will alter the watersheds natural ability to deal with precipitation events.  Roads and culverts channelize runoff, unnaturally increasing runoff energy and downstream affects.  Further exacerbating the pre-existing road network condition is approximately 152.6 miles of bull dozer line that was installed during fire suppression activities (Table 3).  Rehab of dozer line will be extremely important to minimize its contribution to sediment runoff until vegetation recovers.  Dozer line treatments include seeding, water barring, replacing the berm, and increasing roughness with native woody materials. 

Road densities are also going to increase quickly on private and DNR lands due to salvage timber sales that will further destabilize slopes adjacent to many storm conveyance channels (Reeves, et al 2006).  These anthropogenic alterations to the hydrologic condition with the subwatersheds are expected to have an adverse additive effect on sediment delivery and recovery time throughout isolated portions of the burned area.

Table 3.  Miles of bull dozer line constructed during fire suppression activities by jurisdiction. d. Mass wasting and Debris Flows Mass wasting events are difficult to predict because they depend heavily on slope, soils, vegetation, and individual or additive storm events.  In general these are not an entirely unnatural occurrence in post fire environments and fish populations are well adapted to dealing with them.  These events have the potential to transport large quantities of woody material and PrivateStateFederal46.958.747Jurisdictionfill to the valley bottom streams.  Unfortunately, due to the fragmented nature of upper hillslopes and valley bottoms, from infrastructure and road crossings over channels  many of the positive contributions to fish bearing streams will probably not be realized. 

Previous and predicted future debris flows have the potential to affect fish health and habitat on several temporal scales.  Fine particulate delivery to the Lower Methow is expected to significantly increase until the slopes with moderate to high burn intensities stabilize.  This stabilization is expected to occur relatively quickly through loss of hydrophobic soil properties and vegetation establishment.  Improvements to road drainage systems, mulching and bank stabilization will all decrease the intensity and duration of increased turbidity events.  Gravel, cobble, boulders and large wood that reaches fish bearing streams is predicted to improve fish spawning, rearing, and migration habitat.  The duration of these improvements is highly dependent on the size, mobility, location and orientation of the material as well as magnitude and duration proceeding climatological events. 

Large Woody Debris Most moderate and high intensity burn areas occurred in mid and upper slopes adjacent to seasonal and high order perennial stream channels.  This will likely limit increased wood recruitment to the mainstem Methow and designated critical habitat waters within the larger tributary systems.  The one notable exception to this is seen on Beaver Creek, where there was significant mortality to mature cottonwoods within the riparian corridor.

We have observed a dramatic increase in mainstem and tributary/floodplain wood loading caused by tree mortality, increased runoff and flash flooding events.  In general much of this wood was deposited in loose aggregations close to the mean low flow stream margin along the Methow River and its tributaries.  Wood found in this configuration will likely be mobilized during spring runoff events and transported downstream. 

Increased wood recruitment and retention in the Methow would benefit channel bedform, channel complexity, adding allocthonous nutrients, and directly provides rearing, cover and spawning habitat. 

Figure 7. Convective storm induced debris flow adjacent Beaver Creek  Modeled Peak Flows To refine and validate field estimates of watershed response, 8 drainages within the fire perimeter were selected for hydraulic analysis (Figure 3). 

Drainages were selected for modeling based on the percentage of moderate and high soil burn severity, values at risk downstream, and the observed response from recent thunderstorms on August 13th and 20th.

Data from the soil burn severity map were used to estimate peak flow using two different hydrologic models. 

The Wildcat5 and Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment (AGWA) models were used for 8 selected drainages with significant amounts of private and state lands. 

Wildcat 5 estimates peak flow and runoff volume from modeled storms at the outlet of the modeled drainage. 

AGWA estimates peak flow, percent increase in flow, and sediment delivery for the outlet, as well as for all channel segments upstream of the outlet. 

Model results are not accurate for use as an estimate of absolute values for flow. 

Rather, should be used to estimate the relative percent change in expected flows. 

Input to the models included drainage characteristics, inherent soil conditions, changed soil conditions due to the fire, and precipitation. 

The models were run using a 1 hr duration 25 year recurrence interval storm, which for the fire area was determined to be 0.77ﬂ per NOAA Atlas 2 methodology. 

Both models estimate storm runoff only, not base flow.

AGWA results are shown in Figure 3 and Wildcat5 in Table 4.

Results for both the AGWA and Wildcat5 models for a 25 year 1 hour storm confirmed field findings that several drainages are now particularly prone to increased flow events. 

Based on the model results, subwatershed mod/high soil burn severity summary, subwatershed topography, and evidence from storms during the middle of August, the areas of highest likelihood of watershed response appear to be:

Frazer Creek  Benson Creek Canyon Creek Leecher Creek Cow Creek Chiliwist Creek Three steep unnamed tributaries of the Methow River downstream of Black Canyon Creek All of these drainages have increased risk from runoff generated on burned hillslopes. 

Risks to downstream values vary and depend on the location of the values specific to each drainage. 

This determination highlights areas of concern, but does not exclude other areas from consideration for emergency treatments. 

Other drainages also have the potential to respond to precipitation events.  Figure 8.  Thickness of blue stream segments represent percent difference in flow between pre and post-fire conditions (thicker lines equate to greater increase in post-fire flows). 

Based on field observations completed during this BAER assessment, many of the high and moderate severity burns have a high potential for surface erosion from overland flow that may enter headwater channels causing sediment bulking that can be transported during subsequent high flows. Sediment delivery in a 25 year storm event will deliver anywhere between 3-21 tons/acre in high to moderate burn severity areas with a potential delivery of 1229 yd3/mile2 . The majority of this material will likely affect ESA listed fish migrating through the lower Methow River given most sediment delivery is expected from steep non-fishing bearing streams.  With the exception of a small percentage of bull trout that use the mainstem Methow for rearing/overwintering, most ESA listed fish in the Methow are migratory and moving upstream to more ideal spawning areas; pulses of sediment will be of short duration with minimized adverse effects.    VII. Treatment Recommendations No emergency treatments have been identified specifically to protect fisheries resources. 

However, fisheries resources could benefit from the effects of recommended treatments designed to improve public safety and decrease risk to infrastructure from post fire effects. 

Treatments, such as mulching and seeding,  that are designed to  decrease fine sediment transport will benefit fish habitat throughout the watershed.  Improvements to road drainage networks through increased culvert capacity, hardened dips, out sloping roads, decommissioning roads and construction of settling basins are expected to have a positive effect on downstream sediment loading and decrease the risk of road prism failure.  Road failure has the potential to add significant fine sediment to streams, similarly to mass wasting events and flash floods though without the benefits of bedload and wood debris.  Culvert replacements in fish bearing streams should be designed for upstream fish passage and be designed to allow bedload and wood material to move downstream. 

Increasing the capacity for material transport within the drainage network should be pursued. 

Bottle necks like private driveway crossings, county road crossings and culverts which trap material and require mechanical removal should be updated to allow natural transport. 

In many cases this means installing bridges, oversized culvert or large box culverts to allow unfettered large material transport. 

Treatments which decrease floodplain capacity, channel capacity, channel roughness, floodplain roughness, large wood recruitment potential and riparian vegetation should be avoided.  This is especially important in fish bearing streams and non-fish bearing perennial streams. 

Some examples of these treatments which conflict with fish habitat improvements include: installation of undersized culverts, point protection with dykes, rip-rapping, wood removal and riparian clearing.

Figure 9. Photo depicts cottonwood regrowth since from July 20, 2014 to September 8, 2014.   VIII. Recommendations for Near and Long Term Recovery Increase/encourage large wood recruitment and retention to mainstem Methow River and fish bearing tributaries. 

Restore natural floodplain function and channel dynamics within perennial fish bearing streams. The need for this action is particularly evident in Fraser Creek where continued floodplain constriction will likely produce large quantities of fine sediment.

Consider Brook Trout eradication in Frazer Creek in 2015.  The recent flood events in Frazer Creek have likely decimated brook trout populations and now may be the ideal time to ensure complete removal.  Further upstream investigation is necessary to determine if there is a seed source for Brook Trout in this system.

Limit excessive fine sediment delivery to fish bearing streams but allow for bedload materials to be transported. 

Bedload provides cobbles and gravels for spawning and larger material for rearing habitat.  Work with engineers to design anthropogenic features which accomplish ecological and infrastructure objectives.

Riparian replanting and maintenance where weed invasions could impair native vegetation recovery.  This should be efforted in in fish bearing and perennial streams. 

Improve irrigation diversion structures to accommodate increased sediment loads predicted to affect stream conditions for the next 5-7 years.  Additionally, fish screens should be updated to improve function and decrease maintenance requirements.

Improve or reestablish fish passage at irrigation diversions and road crossings.

Remove and upgrade undersized culverts and bridges that routinely cause property damage and require debris removal to function.

IX. 

Monitoring Recommendations Temperature monitoring in Beaver Creek Sediment monitoring in spawning areas in Beaver Creek and lower Methow Fish population recovery in Beaver Creek.  Fish populations in the lower 6 miles of Beaver Creek were likely severely reduced by recent flooding and debris flows. 

Recolonization will likely occur quickly.  A robust fish distribution data set was collected in the years prior to the fire and provides a good opportunity to measure population recovery following a major disturbance. 

Fish Habitat Enhancement project performance should be monitored in Beaver Creek and lower Methow River.

Several major fish habitat projects were completed in 2012 and 2013 and were burned over by the fire.  Comparing the recover y of these treated areas to non-treated area could provide important information that could be used in future project designs.

STATE/PRIVATE LAND BURNED AREA EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN CARLTON COMPLEX FIRE ENGINEERING RESOURCE ASSESSMENT NRCS EWP PROGRAM SUMMARY Background

The U.S. Department of Agriculture™s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) administers the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program, This program responds to emergencies created by natural disasters. EWP is designed to help people and conserve natural resources by relieving imminent hazards to life and property caused by floods, fires, windstorms, and other natural occurrences. EWP is an emergency recovery program where NRCS and a local sponsor work together through watershed protection projects. Funding for EWP is subject to Congressional approval.

EWP is designed for installation of recovery measures. 

Activities include (not limited to) providing financial and technical assistance to:  o Remove debris from stream channels, road culverts, bridges, and protect eroded bank o Protect jeopardized water control structures and public infrastructures o Correct damaged drainage facilities, o Establish cover on critically eroding lands, o Repair levees and structures, and  o Repair damaged upland sites stripped of protective vegetation by fire or drought o Repair conservation practices.      Sponsors must be a legal subdivision of the State, such as a city, county, improvement district, conservation district, Indian Tribe, or Tribal organization. 

Sponsors are responsible for:  o Providing landowner rights to do repair work o Securing the necessary permits o Furnishing the local cost share o Accomplishing the installation of work o Work can be done either through Federal or local contracts

Proposed EWP for at Risk Structures In response to the Carlton Fire Complex, NRCS field visited a majority of the burn area during the wee ks of August 3 and August 10 and identified initial at risk homes. In addition, NRCS used work completed by the Multi-jurisdiction Assessment Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team to identify several additional structures overlooked during the initial site visit and evaluation. Burn intensity BARC maps and Forest Service, National Weather Service, and U.S. Geological Survey modeling efforts assisted with this work.

Currently, NRCS is seeking funding to protect the identified homes that are at risk of flooding due to the fires. 

Okanogan Conservation District is the sponsor who will work with NRCS and the landowners to implement various protection methods. These methods include but are not limited to rolling dips, flood diversion dikes, road regrades, earthfill super sacks, and jersey barriers as well as other types of protection methods. Funding is on a case-by-case basis based on the work necessary to repair or protect a site. NRCS only provides funding for the work necessary to reduce applicable threats.

High soil burn severity areas within the Carlton Fire areas are subject to spread of noxious weed communities and invasive species. Many of the noxious weed and invasive species have the potential to out compete native plant communities during post fire recovery. The treatments designed are to protect sensitive native plant communities and supplement remaining native seed banks that promote native plant community recovery and reduce the potential for invasion of noxious weeds into areas disturbed by fire suppression activities and in all burn severity areas. 

Types Species Identified in the fire area:

Table 1. Invasive Weed species known to occur in and near the Station Fire area

Cheat grass

Verbascum thapsus Common mullein

Linaria dalmatica ssp. dalmatica Dalmatian Toadflax B Linaria vulgaris Yellow Toadflax B Cynoglossum officinale Houndstongue B Euphorbia esula Leafy Spurge B Cirsium arvense Canadian Thistle C Carduus nutans Musk Thistle B Onopordum acanthium Scotch Thistle B         *Note: additional species may be listed with local weed board

Risk of introduction of new weed species and/or infestations during the incident:

Map DR-4188 shows the locations of the dozer lines and other fire lines in relation to the burn area. As of September 10, 2014, there was a total of 152.6 miles of completed dozer lines. The dozer lines extend far beyond the final burn perimeter as they were built in anticipation of the fire spreading even further. All dozer lines should be considered contaminated with weed seeds.      Spread of existing weed infestations:

Well known pathways of weed spread such as roads, trails, and drainages occur within the fire area. In addition, the area receives frequent strong winds which are capable of spreading weed seeds, and high levels of use by the public who inadvertently act as vectors for noxious weed spread. Because of dozer lines, hand lines, roads, and previously infested areas encompass approximately 256,108 acres of state, federal, and private land.  The newly burned soil is vulnerable to rapid establishment of noxious weeds and invasive, non-native plants. Add to this the presence of 152.6 miles of new dozer lines, (areas of soil disturbance), and 26.7 miles of hand lines, and it is clear that without prompt action, the potential for an explosion of invasive weeds on high and moderately burned soils, along with the dozer and hand lines is extremely high. Local Noxious Weed and Invasive Species Information: The Washington State Noxious Weed List controlled by the State Weed Control Board.

It contains all of the Statewide Class A noxious weeds.

Class A weeds are of very limited distribution in Washington State and are in a category of mandatory eradication of the entire plant.

Class B weeds are more widespread, but need consideration and required control: means required to stop seed production.

Class C weeds are fairly widespread and not considered feasible to require eradication. 

However, it does not mean the species doesn™t warrant severe concern and eradication action at the local scale. Washington State Weed Board: http://www.nwcb.wa.gov/

Okanogan County Weed board: http://www.okanogancounty.org/nw/

TREATMENTS TO MITIGATE THE EMERGENCY It is necessary to conduct noxious weed detection surveys to evaluate the potential for spread from existing populations and from the activities associated with fire suppression. The following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of irreversible damage to native vegetation from noxious weed and invasive species to spread in the burn area:  a. Conduct weed detection surveys to identify and remove newly discovered infestations adjacent to existing weed infestations.                     b. Conduct weed detection surveys and remove newly discovered infestations along dozer & hand lines, and inside and around noted polygons of high and moderate burn severity areas that are designated for reseeding.                     c. Treat areas with herbicides, mechanical practices.                           d. Seed dozer lines with native seed to discourage repeated ground disturbance and further weed spread from ORV recreation/ activities.    Burn conditions: The burn condition in the state and private lands varied in severity. The majority of the affected land for State and Private land was listed in the Moderately Burned Severity category totaling 75%, compared to 17% Light Burned Severity, and 8% High Burn Severity. 

The focus is to treat soils that are in the high and moderate burn severity where soil erosion may affect critical values, soil productivity, and invasion of noxious weeds and invasive species.

Risks & Values: The findings of the BAER team September 4 through September 10, 2014. Two major issues exist: (1) the potential for weeds to spread at a faster rate from existing infestations as a result of the fire, and (2) the risk of new invasive species introduction. These introductions could come from heavy equipment, vehicles, fire engines, base camps, firefighting crews. Areas of special concern are along dozer and hand lines. 

In addition, post fire operations pose and additional seed source of noxious weeds. 

There are a total of 152.6 miles of completed dozer lines and 26.7 hand lines.

Location / (suitable) Sites:

The proposed treatments are designed for dozer and hand lines on state land (only) that were untreated, where noxious weed pressure is expected to be high on native plant communities. In addition, the BAER Team proposed sights to enhance soil productivity lessen soil loss down slope and lower possible future mass flow events in reaches that may affect critical values (personal property, and infrastructure) in or near proposed seeding sites.

Mullen, and Leafy Spurge. Additional species listed in local area The BAER team recommends chemical treatment for spaying of noxious weeds & invasive species along with cultural treatments. A field survey is needed to determine sites along roadsides, when found and in and near selected polygons. Noxious weed and invasive plant treatments are often site-specific. They include mechanical, cultural, chemical or biological control methods. 

The focus is not on eradication in this situation but control and management until native species come back.  The recommended treatments may lessen future infestations. 

More than one treatment method may enhance noxious weed control; one such approach is to use plant competition along with biological controls like Integrated Pest Management (IPM). This help to restoring disturbed sites to prevent weed reoccurrences and provide competition for the weeds is essential.

Treatment Methods: Chemical Mechanical Biological Treatments Cultural Treatment Chemical

Chemical spaying for noxious weeds and invasive plants is dependent on the size of infestations and site conditions.

Mechanical Mechanical Control treatments help disrupt weed growth. Mechanical weed control is the oldest method used. Treatments often used are tillage, hoeing, hand pulling, cultivation, mulching, and mowing. Common Mechanical  Tillage works by disturbing the root system by dislodging or cutting the root system resulting in desiccation of the plant. 

Tillage easily controls small weeds and most effective in hot, dry environments. Often repeat tillage when new shoots emerge (typically every two weeks). 

This can help to control weed growth but often take one or two growing seasons. 

Mowing is another treatment that reduces annual weed growth. Like tillage it must be performed numerous times. Mowing however will not prevent seed production as the plants tend flower again closer to the ground. 

This has been often noted with Spotted and Diffuse Knapweed. The knapweed plant will adjust to the level of the mower and go to seed.  Biological Control Biological control is the use of living organisms to suppress weed populations to an acceptable level. The insects used are natural enemies of the targeted species that come from the weed's native ecosystem. The use of biological controls impacts its targeted species in two ways:  1. Direct Impact - destroys vital plant tissues and functions 2. Indirect Impact - increases stress on the targeted species to reduce the plants ability to compete with desirable plants. The use if bio-controls may take several years to become established in order to make an impact on the targeted species. 

Using multiple treatments like chemical spaying outside a known boundary along with IPM™s are often used to keep pests in a targeted area.

Cultural Weed Control Cultural weed control treatments used with other treatments provide sound practices for land use in a variety of settings. The planting desirable vegetation, use of goats or livestock along with good grazing management are known methods of cultural weed control treatments. 

The planting of cereal grain crops, grasses, or in combinations that compete for sunlight, water, and soil nutrients with weeds. Rapid establishment is vital to success providing the best chance to resist noxious weed and intrusive species invasions. Disturbed sites, roadways, and fence lines are most susceptible and often where invasions occur first. Invasions start when seeds are brought in by vehicles, or when soil disturbance occurs from operations. 

Note:  not all treatments intended for noxious weed or invasive plant eradication.

For more information consult Noxious Weed Control Board or local Cooperative Extension Agent in your area.

Carlton Complex Northeast 10/06/2014

Carlton Complex Northeast Briefing  ::  Page 1 of 5  ____________________________________ Team Leader: TJ Clifford, Boise District BLM Contact: Stuart Woolley swoolley@fs.fed.us 509-664-9332

The Carlton Complex north of Wenatchee, Washington began as four fires: the Stokes Fire, the Gold Hikes Fire, the French Creek Fire, and the Cougar Flat Fire. These four fires burned together into one larger fire. Hot weather and windy conditions pushed the fire over ridgetops and into the town of Pateros, causing a large number of evacuations. 

The fire made significant runs toward the cities of Brewster and Pateros between July 17 and 18, burning approximately 300 homes in its path and destroying critical infrastructure.

The fire burned 255,181 acres Œ 79,795 acres of Forest Service land, 6,157 acres of BLM land, 69,885 acres of Washington State land, and 98,753 acres of privately owned land. 

It was contained at a cost of $68.4 million.

The Carlton Complex fires burned at elevations ranging from 2,800 to about 6,500 feet. 

Vegetation varies across dry pine forests, riparian habitats, mid-elevation mesic forest, and high elevation mix-conifer montane forests. 

Primary conifer species include ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, larch, lodgepole pine, and Engelmann spruce, with subalpine fir found on the highest peaks. 

Aspen also occurs throughout most forest types.

About 32 miles of perennial streams and 97 miles of intermittent streams lie within the burned area. The fires affected about 4 miles of trails and 216 miles of roads.

Indications of water-repellent soils were found throughout all burn severity classes. After post-fire precipitation and subsequent erosion, field transects containing 10 sample points tended toward low-to-moderate hydrophobicity in the burned area. 

Of the 43,053 acres in the three soil burn severity classes, 32,289 acres (75 percent) exhibited some degree of water repellency.

Soil erosion hazard ratings showed 346 acres at low hazard, 3,809 at moderate, and 44,465 acres at high erosion hazard rating.

BAER team members expect an initial flush of ash following precipitation in the fire area, with rill and gully erosion in drainages and on steep slopes. Flash floods are expected, increased peak flows and sediment deposition, along with debris flows. 

Effects will likely be greatest with fall and early winter storms, and disturbances should become less evident as vegetation is reestablished in the spring. The vegetative recovery period is estimated at 3 to 5 years. 

BAER TEAM RESPONSE:

Although the Carlton Complex Fire burned area within the jurisdiction of many private, municipal, state, tribal, and federal agencies, this BAER assessment addresses only emergency threats within the northeast portion  of the Carlton Complex on lands under the jurisdiction of the Methow Valley Ranger District on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. The project area evaluated by the team assigned to this portion of the Carlton Complex was about 48,697 acres. This report includes response actions recommended in accordance with Forest Service Manual (FSM) Interim Directive 2500-2013-1 (Burned Area Emergency Response).  BAER Analysis Briefing:

Carlton Complex Northeast 10/06/2014

Carlton Complex Northeast Briefing  ::  Page 3 of 5 The initial BAER team included specialists in Safety, Engineering, Hydrology, Soils, Cultural Resources, Fisheries, Vegetation, and Geographic Information Systems. On September 2 an in-briefing was held with the District Ranger after coordinating with BAER teams led by Greg Kuyumjian. 

Field assessments were conducted between September 2 and September 7 to evaluate risk to identified values, coordinating with a . similar team led by John Chatel assessing state and private lands.

VALUES AT RISK:

During field assessments, the BAER team focused on values at moderate to very high risk. 

Values of low to no risk are not part of this plan, which includes threats from flooding, hazard trees, and rockfall along roads and at developed and dispersed sites or those downstream or downslope of burned areas. The team evaluated threats along State Highway 20 from the eastern edge of the fire west approximately 4 miles.

Highways and NFS roads:

Risks to road infrastructure exist at intermittent and perennial drainages from flooding and debris flows. Undersized culverts are expected to plug or overtop, damaging road infrastructure and investment.

Steelhead and designated Critical Habitat:  Post-fire runoff, erosion, and sediment delivery threaten steelhead trout and their habitat. There is less than a mile of critical habitat within the fire area, but 27 miles exist 3 miles of the fire perimeter.

Chinook Salmon, Bull Trout, and designated Critical Habitat:

Risks were identified including  post-fire runoff, erosion, and sediment delivery, all of which could negatively affect spring chinook populations and degrade critical habitat, deterring recovery objectives. Though there is no critical habitat designated within the fire area, there are 19 miles within 3 miles of the fire perimeter. The fire area includes 2.1 miles of bull trout critical habitat, with 35 miles within 3 miles of the perimeter of the fire.

Riparian Habitat:

Hydrologic function of hillslopes and channels is at risk because of the loss of soil cover and structure, decreased infiltration, hillslope erosion and sediment delivery to stream channels, and increased stream channel runoff. 

Flooding and debris flows are expected, with channel widening and excessive gully formation. Increased stream flows and channel erosion, along with the loss of grass, forb, and shrub components is expected in areas with moderate and high soil burn severity.

Native Plants and Noxious Weeds:

The slow natural regeneration after moderate-to-high burn severity will negatively affect native or naturalized communities of grass/shrub steppe. 

Known noxious and invasive weed populations include Dalmation toadflax, diffused knapweed, and other species over approximately 1,260 acres within the fire perimeter. These weeds will aggressively compete with native species for space and nutrients in the burned areas. Soil productivity is at risk, with a high probability of immediate detrimental soil displacement in burned areas of moderate and high burn severity. 

The loss of effective ground cover and above-ground organic matter will leave soils susceptible to erosive forces for 3 to 5 years in high severity areas and 2 years in moderate severity areas.     BAER Analysis Briefing:

Carlton Complex Northeast 10/06/2014

Carlton Complex Northeast Briefing  ::  Page 4 of 5 EMERGENCY TREATMENT OBJECTIVES:

Reduce threats to human safety on roads and trails. 

Protect National Forest System investments and minimize damage to travel routes.

Protect critical natural resources within or downstream of the burned area.

Control noxious weeds.

Warn users of Forest roads and trails of hazards.

Consider temporary closure to protect public users of NF lands.

Weeds:

The BAER team recommends monitoring and treating noxious weed infestations and coordinating with private land treatments under the local County Weed Management Agreement. 

Suitable sites may include areas with a high potential for weed/invasive species establishment. 

Critical areas include roads, dozer lines, drop points, fire camps, ephemeral drainages, and burned areas where suppression vehicles and equipment traveled through known noxious weed/non-native invasive species populations. 

Disturbed areas within and along the fire perimeter, such as dozer lines, hand lines, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points will be prioritized for monitoring. 

GPS inventory and mapping are recommended, along with manual and chemical treatments. Biocontrol agents are proposed for

Dalmatian toadflax and diffused knapweed populations as part of the long-term management of known infestations. Projects will be integrated with Okanogan County and the Cooperative Weed Management Area on state and private lands inside and outside the fire perimeter, thus reducing weed control costs to all cooperators.

Seeding:

Noxious weed species can out-compete native plant communities during post-fire recovery. 

The BAER team recommends protecting R6 sensitive plants and supplementing the remaining native seed bank to promote robust recovery of native plants and to avoid conversion of high burn severity areas to noxious weeds. Plans include applying inoculated native seed mix in areas of high soil burn severity adjacent to known noxious weed infestations, using seed mix recommended by the Methow Valley Ranger District Botanist and approved by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest Regional Botanist.

Carlton Complex Northeast 10/06/2014

Carlton Complex Northeast Briefing  ::  Page 5 of 5 Road Drainage Reconstruction:  Proposed projects include approximately 45 miles of the 215 miles within the fire perimeter. Improvements include drain dips, debris racks, culvert installation and/or cleaning, ditch cleaning, fill slop armoring, and road template projects. Projects will protect road infrastructure and minimize sediment delivery into the watersheds that run into

Beaver Creek and the Methow River.

Storm patrols will identify drainage issues such as plugged culverts and washed-out roads and will clear, clean, and/or block damaged roads. 

Targeted roads include Benson Creek Road, South Summit Road,

Volstead Creek Road, and Finley Mountain Road. Travelers along these roads are at risk of rolling and falling rock from burned slopes and falling trees, flash floods, and mudflows. 

Post-fire flooding can interrupt access and initiate erosion, resulting in road blockage or washouts. 

Road closures may include installation of steel pipe or

Powder River style gates to close roads when necessary for public safety. 

Road closure information will be posted on gates and via public notices, and safety signs are included in the projects. 

Ongoing monitoring will ensure that the post-fire projects are completed as prescribed. Effectiveness monitoring for area closures is included to determine whether additional law enforcement presence or public information is needed to achieve compliance and provide for public safety.

The Central Washington Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team assessed burned areas including the Lower Methow River and Swamp Creek / Columbia River watersheds. The assessment area covered 592 miles of stream channels including artificial path (35 miles), canal/ditch (3 miles), intermittent streams (196 miles), perennial streams (358 miles), and pipeline (1 mile) across the Carlton Southwest area, along with 950 miles of roads and 1.2 miles of trails. Soil burn severity surveys confirmed 3,627 acres (10 percent) at very low burn severity, 21,339 acres (61 percent) at low severity, 7,472 acres (21 percent) at moderate severity, and 2,456 acres (7 percent) at high severity burn. Most of the high severity acres are within the subwatershed of the

Alta Coulee-Methow River, McFarland Creek / Methow River, Gold Creek, and Squaw Creek within the Lower Methow River Watershed.

The BAER team requested funding to improve road drainage, install ALERT storm warning systems, initiate storm patrol, install burned area hazard signs and gates, and complete drainage projects to protect roads and public safety.

Forest Service roads in the area are at risk of falling rocks or trees blocking the roadway, damaged or blocked culverts, debris flows, and lost portions of roadway. Access into or out of areas may also be compromised.

The fire caused damage to Hwy. 153, and additional problems caused by runoff and debris flows are expected. Trailhead and campground developments are at risk, along with portions of Hwy. 97, Hwy. 20, and numerous county and Forest Service roads. Also damaged or at risk are utilities infrastructure including phone lines, cable, and powerlines.

Foggy Dew Campground is at risk of flooding and debris flows from Gold Creek tributaries. Private homes in and adjacent to the burned area are at risk from storm runoff and moving debris. Areas of special concern include Pateros, Carlton, Methow, Twisp, Brewster, Okanogan, Malott, Chillawist, and other unincorporated areas of Okanogan County. Irrigation ditches, pipes, and reservoirs may be compromised by storm runoff and flash flooding.   BAER Analysis Briefing:

SW Carlton Complex 09/09/2014    __________________

SW Carlton Complex Assessment Briefing  ::  Page 2 of 3

The Methow River Watershed and subwatersheds have a history of debris flows or sediment movement from post-fire events and other naturally occurring events. Risk-reduction projects for primary routes in the area are planned for Forest Service Roads (FSR) 4010, 4012-100, 4013-200, 4330-400, 4330-470, and 4330-477. 

The southwest portion of the Carlton Fire lies in two watersheds Œ the Lower Methow River and Swamp Creek / Columbia River. 

With upcoming storms and snowmelt, BAER team specialists expect an initial flush of ash, erosion in drainages and on steep slopes, flash flooding, and debris flows. The severity of these events will depend on storm intensity, and should be reduced as vegetation in the area recovers over time.

The BAER team identified the Gold Creek, McFarland Creek, Squaw Creek, and Black Canyon subwatersheds for particular concern. Soil burn severity maps and modeling were combined with field surveys to assess threat and risk in and adjacent to the burned area, and to develop post-fire risk-reduction recommendations. Several post-fire debris flows have already occurred and more are expected.

Expected post-fire effects on the Methow River watershed include increased water temperatures, peak flows and channel scour, surface erosion and sediment delivery, and landslides and debris flows. 

These post-fire effects may negatively affect the survival of fish and fish habitat. 

Unlike some portions of the Methow in the main Carlton Complex, most of the lower fish-bearing tributaries within the Southwest Carlton Complex did not burn at high severity. Large vegetated buffers were intact below high/moderate severity burns, and these buffer areas can protect fish habitat from post-fire impacts.

Increased sediment may affect migrating fish in the lower Methow River, but most sediment increase is expected in steep non-fish-bearing streams. Sediment or a debris flow reaching the Methow River is likely (50-90 percent occurrence within 1-3 years), but consequences should be minor and the risk level is low.

Soil loss through post-fire erosion on high and moderate burn severity areas will likely result in a long-term loss of soil productivity. Areas of high and moderate burn severity are expected to contribute ash and sediment to debris flows; about 72 percent of soils in the area are rated as severe erosion hazard areas. The soils team discussed but did not propose erosion control treatments; seeding has not proven effective in the Pacific Northwest because of seasonal erosion-causing  weather. The 2012 Goat Fire, for example, was evaluated by BAER specialists who noted that in the two years after the fire, natural recovery had progressed quite well, with established forb and grass cover in the area.

The BAER team identified 42 recorded cultural resource sites on Forest Service lands west of the Methow River Valley; those that are either eligible or unevaluated for the National Register of Historic Places are within unburned or low severity areas. None are at risk from post-fire effects.      BAER Analysis Briefing:

SW Carlton Complex 09/09/2014    __________________

SW Carlton Complex Assessment Briefing  ::  Page 3 of 3 Planned risk-reduction projects for the area will provide for safety of downstream landowners, homes, and businesses and will support installation of Automated Local Evaluation in Real Time (ALERT) stations to provide precipitation data for flood forecasting and early warning. Closures will be ordered within and downstream of the burn area where road crossings or other sites are at high risk of flooding or debris flows. 

Other post-fire hazards include snags, stump holes, and falling rocks and trees.

Other projects are planned to protect recreation sites including Foggy Dew Campground, Black Canyon Snow Play Area, and South Fork Gold Creek Snow Play Area. 

Road projects include improving safe access and reducing road-related hazards, reducing surface runoff, and preparing for debris flows that could damage drainage structures.

Storm patrols will be activated during and immediately after storms to repair, unplug, or improve drainage structures along Forest Service roads. The patrols will monitor roads for emergency actions and early alerts.

Ongoing monitoring will ensure that the post-fire projects are completed as prescribed. Effectiveness monitoring for area closures is included to determine whether additional law enforcement presence or public information is needed to achieve compliance and provide for public safety.

SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS4  Although the Carlton Complex Fire burned area within the jurisdiction of many private, municipal, state, tribal, and federal agencies, this BAER assessment addresses only emergency threats to values within the Carlton Complex Fire that burned on lands under the jurisdiction of the Methow Valley Ranger District on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. The project area evaluated by the team assigned to this portion of the Carlton Complex was about 48,697 acres. This report includes response actions recommended in accordance with Forest Service Manual (FSM) Interim Directive 2500-2013-1 (Burned Area Emergency Response).

The objective of the BAER assessment is to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property and critical natural or cultural resources; and take immediate actions to manage unacceptable risks. 

This assessment used methodology outlined in Exhibit 01 and Exhibit 02 of the FSM to guide the identification of critical BAER values important to the local management unit and the apparent risk to those values that now exist from threats associated with the burned area.  The assessment team assigned risk to the critical values by assessing the probability for post-fire damage and the magnitude of consequences, if damage occurred. A wide array of response actions were considered to achieve the emergency response objectives. However, only 3 actions were considered feasible.

The Carlton Complex fires started on July 14, by lightning from a weather system that moved through the Methow Valley. The Carlton Complex started as four fires: the Stokes Fire, the Gold Hikes Fire, the French Creek Fire and the Cougar Flat fire. These fires grew into one larger fire on July 20. The fire grew dramatically on July 17. Hot weather and windy conditions pushed the fire over the ridge tops and into the town of Pateros resulting in a large number of evacuations. The fire made significant runs towards the cities of Brewster and Pateros between July 17th and 18th, consuming approximately 300 homes in its path and 3 PART IV addresses only the NE Portion of the Carlton Fire. 4 PART V addresses only the NE Portion of the Carlton Fire. destroying critical infrastructure. The Okanogan Public Utility Department (PUD) was able to restore power to most of the communities by July 26, 2014. The Okanogan County Emergency Operations Center was opened to help coordinate and reestablish the affected communities. Community meetings were held in Pateros, Brewster, Twisp, Malott, Winthrop, Canyon and Methow. 

Great Basin Incident Management Team 1 assumed command of the Carlton Complex, along with the Little Bridge Creek Fire and the Upper Falls Fire, at 8 p.m. on August 11th. 

Recent significant rain has caused some slides within the burn scar area. Cooperating agencies during these efforts included the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Washington State Department of Natural Resources, (WA DNR), Bureau of Land Management, WA Department of Fish & Wildlife, Okanogan Fire District 6, Okanogan Fire District 15 and the Okanogan County Sheriff™s Office. 

A Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) Team was assembled and consisted of individuals representing Safety, Engineering, Hydrology, Soils, Cultural Resources, Fisheries, Vegetation, and Geographic Information Systems.  On September 2, 2014, an in-briefing was held with the District Ranger after coordinating with BAER team™s led by Greg Kuyumjian. Field assessments were conducted between September 2nd and September 7th, 2014 by BAER Team members to evaluate risk to identified values. Our team continued to closely coordinate with a similar team that was concurrently assessing State and Private Lands and led by John Chatel. 

Values that may be threatened due to post fire events were identified during the initial scoping meetings. 

During the course of field assessments, the BAER Team refined the values list to those that are at moderate to very high risk due to post fire events.  Values of low to no risk are discussed in the resource assessments, but are not part of this plan.

Treatment Narrative: (Describe the emergency treatments, where and how they will be applied, and what they are intended to do.  This information helps to determine qualifying treatments for the appropriate funding authorities. For seeding treatments, include species, application rates and species selection rationale.)

These treatments were developed by each of the respective resource groups as part of a specification sheet that helped guide narrative and cost considerations. Each treatment proposal was then captured within this document.  Since the development of those specification sheets, the team leader has communicated with BAER Coordinators at forest, regional, or national levels to ensure consistency with BAER authority. 

Therefore, this document, with the included treatment description and design, supersedes all prior versions.

Land Treatments L01 - Early Detection & Rapid Response (EDRR)

General Description of Treatment: Monitor and treat noxious weed infestations on FS lands associated with suppression activities and BAER treatments.  This treatment may be coordinated with private land treatments under the local County Weed Management Agreement. 

Suitable Sites: Assess areas that have a high potential for weed/invasive species establishment.  Critical areas include roads, dozer lines, drop point, fire camps, and ephemeral drainages and burned areas where suppression vehicles and equipment traveled through known noxious weed/non-native invasive plant species populations.  Disturbed areas within and along the fire perimeter, such as dozer lines, hand lines, staging areas, safety zones and drop points will also be prioritized for monitoring.    Design/Construction Specifications: 1. Conduct short-term monitoring in FY2015 using early detection and rapid response (EDRR) assessment/monitoring of noxious weed/non-native invasive plant species infestations within the burned area.  Monitoring to determine the post-fire presence or spread of invasive species will be initiated in close proximity to known weed populations on the lower slopes in the shrub-grass steppe and dry pine forest; transitioning to mesic forest, ephemeral springs, wet meadow riparian, and mixed-conifer montane communities within the fire perimeter. 2. Inventory/assessment, photos and map new noxious weed infestations within burned area using GPS technology. 

This information will be uploaded into the Methow Valley Ranger District GIS Noxious Weeds database with regular program funds. 3. Manual and chemical treatments using a variety of tools including pickups, UTVs and backpack spray units will be used on any noxious weeds located within the fire on forest service lands.   4. Biocontrol agents may be released on Dalmatian toadflax and diffused knapweed to replace preexisting biocontrols that didn™t survive the fire.  These biocontrols are part of long-term management of larger known infestations. 5. By integrating EDRR project with Okanogan County, Cooperative Weed Management Area on state and private lands inside and outside the fire perimeter, the forest will reduce noxious weed populations throughout the area and thus reducing weed control costs to all cooperators.

Purpose of Treatment:

Noxious or invasive weeds are treated to stabilize and prevent unacceptable degradation to native plant community, natural, and cultural resources. Treating noxious and invasive weeds prevents the serious threat to native plant diversity, structure, and composition.  The BAER Team considered this treatment to be the minimum necessary to achieve a reduction in risk to the identified critical values of:    1. Native and naturalized vegetative communities

Describe Treatment Effectiveness Monitoring: Follow-up monitoring with program funds will occur in 2nd & 3rd years as needed if new or expanded weed populations are discovered during the 1st year BAER treatments.

L03 - Seeding General Description of Treatment:

High soil burn severity areas within the Carlton Fire are subject to being captured by adjacent noxious weed communities.  Many of the noxious weed species have the potential to out compete the native plant community during the post-fire recovery period.  This treatment is designed to protect the R6 sensitive plants and supplement the remaining native seed bank in order to promote a more robust recovery of the native plant community and avoid the potential for the conversion of the selected high soil burn severity areas to noxious weeds.

Suitable Sites:

The proposed treatments are designed for the areas occurring adjacent to forest roads and in polygons where noxious weed pressure on the native plant community is expected to be high. 

Design/Construction Specifications:

Apply inoculated native seed mix to roadside buffers and polygons in areas of high soil burn severity adjacent to known noxious weed infestations.  Use seed mix recommended by the Methow Valley Ranger District Botanist and approved by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest Regional Botanist.  Apply seed mix at a rate of 20.15 pounds per acre, based on Critical Area Planting standards.   1. Seed will be pretreated with plant specific mycorrhizal inoculant at 1 pound per 20 pounds of seed mix. 2. Seed will be applied by hand mechanical seeders on locations identified on the treatment map.  3. Seeding should occur in late fall or early winter which will allow seed to naturally stratify.  4. Seed can be broadcast directly onto snow. 5. The seed mix was provided by Kelly Baraibar, Methow Valley Ranger District Botanist (509-996-4019).  A seeding rate of 20 pounds per acre will be used, based on the existing site conditions which coincide with the concepts established by the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service, Critical Area Planting Standard 342.  A higher than normal seeding rate is being proposed for areas that will be aerial seeded to account for seed drift.  Prices for seed mixes listed below are estimated at the 25 lbs/acre price.  The cost of seed will decrease where it is applied by hand at the 20 lbs/acre price. 

There will also be areas where a lower seeding rate will be applied to evaluate and monitor appropriate seeding rates for future knowledge.  Costs will also decrease if the Forest Service can partner with the DNR to share implementation costs such as helicopter time. 6. Treatment includes 108 acres of 20 foot wide buffers along roads and outside of documented noxious weed populations (or above and below disturbed road prism width) within the high soil burn severity areas and 719 acres of seeding within upland polygons that have a high probability of noxious weed infestations (see treatment map for locations). 7. A monitoring plan for post BAER seeding effectiveness will be submitted prior to spring green-up.

Purpose of Treatment: Fire is a disturbance that provides a receptive avenue for the spread of noxious weeds and/or invasive species.

Noxious weeds and non-native invasive species are a concern for native plant communities. 

Weed invasion is a potentially threatening process leading to competition and habitat modification.  This treatment is necessary to prevent the establishment and to control the spread of noxious weeds and non-native invasive species into certain high soil burn severity areas of the Carlton Fire.

Since one seed mix will be applied over different seed zones, four different species are recommended in the seed mix to help guarantee success.  Native communities are at high risk of type conversion to Knapweed and/or Toadflax and other non-native weeds by the spread of weed seed into high soil burn severity areas.  This treatment targets areas of pre-fire native plant communities that included, among other native and naturalized plants, the following R6 sensitive plants; Botrychium ascendens,  Botrychium crenulatum, Botrychium lineare, Botrychium paradoxum, Botrychium pedunculosum, and Mimulus pulsifera. 

The BAER team considered this treatment the minimum necessary to achieve a reduction in risk to the accumulated critical values of: 1. Native and Naturalized plant communities

This treatment is intended to achieve four sequential objectives: a) Maintain the natural bio-diversity of the native plant community by providing a buffer from known areas of noxious weeds. b) Supplement the native seed bank, which was damaged by the high soil burn severity. c) Protect the habitat of the R6 Sensitive plants from encroachment by and conversion to noxious weeds. d) Increase the transfer of available soil moisture and nutrients buy pretreating the seed with mycorrhizal inoculant.  Describe Treatment Effectiveness Monitoring:  1. Visually inspect seeded areas to determine the percentage of seed mix germination. 2. Visually inspect, over several growing periods, the areas along roads that were buffered by the seeding and larger polygons that were seeded in order to determine the presence of noxious weeds. 3. Check short feeder roots and soil matrix for the cottony white appearance of fungal mycelia. 

Inspection.  Note: Symbiotic mycorrhizae associated with plant roots will not promote or show root decay.       Roads and Trail Treatments Treatment #R1a Œ Construct/Improve Armored Drainage Sag: Construct outsloped drain sags with armoring for diverting and removing water off the road surface, as well as draining any roadway ditch.  Typical drainage sags are 30-50 ft in length and create a low water trough to redirect drainage flow.  Drainage sags are installed in natural grade break in the road prism.  Actual spacing of drainage sags will be based on Forest Service Handbook direction and location of topographical features, particularly in areas where active streams are crossing the road.  (See Engineering report for detail) Treatment #R1b Œ Construct/Improve Unarmored Drainage Sag: Construct outsloped drain sags for diverting and removing water off the road surface, as well as draining any roadway ditch. Typical drainage sags are 30-50 ft in length and create a low water trough to redirect drainage flow. 

Drainage sags are installed in natural grade break in the road prism.  Actual spacing of drainage sags will be based on Forest Service Handbook direction and location of topographical features, particularly in areas where active streams are crossing the road.  (See Engineering report for detail) Treatment #R2a Œ Construct/Improve Armored Drainage Dip1: Construct outsloped drain dips with armoring for diverting and removing water off the road surface, as well as draining any roadway ditch.  Typical drainage dips or rolling dips on steeper grades (5-12% grades) have a one (1) foot trough depth and range between 120 to 140 feet in length including taper with the cross slope of the roadbed maintained through the dip.  Drain dips rely on a mound of soil at the downhill side to stop water. Actual spacing of drainage dips will be based on Forest Service Handbook direction and location of topographical features.  (See Engineering report for detail) Treatment #R2b Œ Construct/Improve Unarmored Drainage Dip1: Construct/improve outsloped drain dips for diverting and removing water off the road surface, as well as draining any roadway ditch.

(See Engineering report for detail) Treatment #R3 Œ Construct Armored Ford2: Construct outsloped drainage feature with armoring to improve anticipated increases in stream flow including debris, keeps the flow in the same drainage, thus reducing diversion potential and usually prevents a total fill failure.  Fords will be located based on locations of existing culverts and length of armor will depend on field conditions at each site.  (See Engineering report for detail) Treatment #R4 Œ Hydrologically close road: 1. Construct/Improve drain dips:  Construct drain dips to enable maintenance level 1 roads to better handle expected increases in surface runoff.  Drain dips are recommended due to the steepness of the road prism which renders water bars ineffective.  Actual spacing of drain dips will be based on Forest Service Handbook direction.   2. Remove Existing Culverts:  Remove existing culvert and associated road fill in selected channel or draw locations to reestablish more natural flow pattern and reduce the risk of culvert plugging due to increased sedimentation loading from the upslope fires.  Removed road fill to be used to construct a drain dip down gradient of crossing to prevent the risk of further sedimentation from the road.    3. Construct road closure berms:

Treatment #R5 Œ Fabricate and install gate:  Fabricate/purchase and install closure gates and burned area hazard notification signs to inform the public of post-fire conditions and management actions taken to protect the public safety (roads, trails and trailheads).  Gates will allow the Forest Service to provide essential access to private lands and protect the public from existing and potential road washouts as a least cost alternative.  A gate is to be located at the beginning FSR 4013200. 

Treatment #R6 ŒSurface Water Management:  Clean inlets and outlets of existing relief culverts and those culverts in active stream channels to reduce the buildup of sedimentation which may lead to fill failure along road grades >2% within or directly downslope or downgrade of moderately to high intensity burn areas in areas contiguous with critical fisheries habitat.  Treatment includes installation of temporary erosion control during construction. 

Treatment #R7 Œ Storm Patrol:  Patrol area during and immediately after storm events to repair, unplug, or aid in drainage of road drainage features along FS Road 4010, 4012100, 4013200 and 40330400 to the closure, to reduce the risk of catastrophic road drainage failure and high sedimentation yield.  As the remaining open access for administration and public, it is important to monitor this road. Recommend two person teams to complete the assessment.  Days include 5 days for road crew backhoe to complete emergency mitigation action. 

RT01 - Road Drainage Reconstruction General Description:

Roads were found to have issues with their drainage system due to the expected increase in flows.

A variety of treatments intended to repair and restore the drainage features associated with these roads are prescribed.

Additional treatments designed to help stormproof the road crossings at the more significant drainage ways are also included.  Specifics of each of these treatments are listed in the engineering Treatment Specifications.

Suitable Sites: The roads are listed in the detailed specifications for engineering and on the treatment map. 

The roads are listed individually and represent approximately 28 miles of the 215 miles within the fire perimeter.  The engineers determined that suitable road segments must meet the following criteria:  1. Located below or within areas with slopes burned at moderate to high severity, 2. Have a continuous grade and infrequent drainage structures, 3. Contain culverts that have diversion potential, and 4. Located on roads where frequencies between inspection and maintenance may be limited after the fire.

Design/Construction Specifications: This treatment will include a ﬁsystemﬂ of design/construction methods depending on the prisms current condition.  The details of this treatment are provided in the engineering report and associated specifications and will be completed per Forest Service standards.  1. Drain Dips (with or without armor) Œ In the event of a plugged culvert or excessive runoff, roadway drain dips allow surface flows to go over the road without flowing along the road  preventing excessive erosion of the surface. They also deflect flow from heavy rain or ditch overload off the road surface preventing surface erosion.  Modify the road drainage by altering the template and allowing surface cross-flows to occur at a designated location.  Place rock rip rap where runoff could potentially cause erosion to the road surface and fillslope.  Construct rolling drain dips per Forest Service and/or BLM standards.     2. Debris Racks Œ The debris rack is a barrier in front of the culvert inlet or across the channel upstream of the culvert that is used to prevent debris from plugging the culvert.

Debris racks shall be constructed of wood or steel and installed where indicated or found to be necessary on or above the inlet of culverts.  Debris rack design shall be such that it will capture the woody debris material delivered with the expected flows in each of the drainages. Debris racks may require periodic cleaning to maintain effectiveness.  3. Culvert Cleaning Œ Culvert cleaning includes the cleanout of catchment basins, inlets and outlets. 

The cleanout of catchment-basins below the inlet of the culvert is done to capture the sediment transported from the channel or ditch.  Remove any blockages from inlet, outlet and inside barrel. 

Straighten bent inlets.  Catchment-basins shall have all existing silt and debris removed and either hauled away or spread out such that the material cannot reenter the drainage structure during a runoff event.   4. Heavy Culvert Cleaning Œ Remove large quantities of sediment and debris from culvert inlets, outlets, catchment basins and inlet channel areas using heavy earth-moving equipment.  Care shall be taken to avoid damage to culvert inlets  Removal of sediment and debris from within the culvert via hydro-jetting or other methods approved by the Engineer. Enlarging catchment basins may be necessary to handle increased flows.  Excavate and re-shape the inlet channel area to direct increased runoff to the culvert catchment basin.   5. Ditch Cleaning Œ Ditches need to be cleaned and in some cases enlarged to handle increased flows. Their cleanout is required to remove any debris that may reduce ditch capacity or deflect the flow out of the ditch. It is also to ensure the flow reaches the outflow structure without ponding or flowing on the road surface.  All drain ditches along the length of the roads shall have all accumulated silt and debris removed and either hauled away or spread out such that the material cannot reenter the drainage structure during a runoff event.  6. Road Template Reshaping - Road surfaces that could channel water down the roadway need to be reshaped to exaggerate crowing or sloping to more effectively  shed increased flows quickly before road surface erosion occurs.  Reshape the road surface to provide positive drainage to ditches, culverts, or outslope.  Remove any berm to allow water flow off of the roadbed.  This treatment will be applied to road templates where drain dip construction is not feasible due to road standard or grade.  Cost per mile is equivalent.   7. Fill Slope Armoring Œ Install rip-rap along fill slopes along steep grades or channels.  Place rip rap below the drain outlet to dissipate the energy from the flow.  Where indicated by the Engineer armor fill slopes using riprap and geotextile material to secure slope and prevent fines from washing out of fill slope.

Generally, reshape the road surface to provide positive drainage to ditches and culverts.  Remove berm where water will flow off roadbed, repair large ruts in the middle of the roadbed that channel water downgrade.  Describe Purpose of Treatment:

The purpose of this treatment is to mitigate additional risk to Human Life and Safety, property, emergency ingress/egress, loss of access to visitors and local residents, and impacts to water quality, riparian, and bull trout (listed species).  Approx. 215 miles of Forest Roads are located within the fire perimeter, representing a significant financial property investment.  Protect road infrastructure and minimize sediment delivery into the watersheds that run into Beaver Creek and the Methow River which contain listed fish species (bull trout).The BAER Team considered this treatment to be the minimum necessary to achieve a reduction in risk to the accumulated critical values of:   1. Safety of visitors, private residents, and agency personnel  2. Forest roads and bridges  3. Emergency ingress and egress 4. Loss of access 5. Soil productivity  6. Hydrologic function(including riparian and stream channel stability)   7. Critical Fish Habitat 8. Water quality of two major reservoirs and designated, occupied critical habitat

Describe Treatment Effectiveness Monitoring: Monitor the storm-patrol response time to ensure objectives are being met.  Identify the type of storm event that mobilizes material.

RT03 -- Culvert Removals General Description: This treatment is for the removal of existing culverts at stream crossings on Forest Roads.  The culvert crossings were identified as being undersized due to the anticipated increase in flows from the burned watersheds above the crossings.  These culverts will be removed and have the road fill pulled back to match the surrounding stream banks in order to pass the increased flows that are anticipated from future storm events.  The Engineer may direct that crossing on maintenance level 2 roads be shaped to form a ford for passage of high clearance vehicles during dry periods. At all other crossings the stream channel will be armored with riprap, reducing the potential for head cutting and scour through the new channel.  The treatment is primarily for undersized pipe crossings primarily located on maintenance level 1 roads, which are closed to all motorized traffic, and maintenance level 2 roads that are maintained for high clearance vehicles and where the cost of replacing the culverts exceed the benefit to the road system. 

The purpose of this treatment is to reduce the risk of pipe failure and associated sediment delivery to critical resources.  Roads within the Carlton Complex Fire contain drainage structures that cross primarily intermittent streams located in watersheds that have a moderate to high burn severity.  These streams now have the potential for increased runoff and debris flows.  These increases in flows pose a threat to the existing crossings which may result in plugging culverts or exceeding their maximum flow capacity.  If these flows plug drainage structures the result could be additional erosion and debris further down the drainage due to the failures of the road fill slopes, thereby impacting water quality.  ii. 

How does the treatment relate to damage or changes caused by the fire? Increased runoff resulting from burned slopes and stream channels which intersect roads may cause culverts to fail from debris slides or from stream flow which exceeds the design capacity of the culvert. In certain cases, to minimize the risk of pipe failure the potential impacts to property, water quality, and human life and safety, it is beneficial and appropriate to remove the pipe, reconstruct the channel, and close the road to traffic.

RT04 Œ Storm Patrols General Description: The patrols are used to identify those road problems such as compromised drainage issues such as plugged culverts and washed out roads and to clear, clean, and/or block those roads that have received damage.  The storm patrollers shall have access to at least a backhoe and dump truck that can be used when a drainage culvert is plugged or soon to be plugged, and to repair roads which are exhibiting severe surface erosion.      Suitable Sites:

Refer to BAER Treatment Map.  The patrols should first focus on those roads and bridges that receive the most traffic, are of more value to the transportation system, and/or have high-risk structures that are prone to storm damage.  Not listed in any order of preference, these roads include the following:

NFSR 4150000 (Benson Creek Road)

NFSR 4100000 (South Summit Road)

NFSR 4250200 (Volstead Creek Road)

NFSR 4100300 (Finley Mtn Road)

Other roads within the fire perimeter will need to be patrolled in the spring after runoff and after all severe storm events.  Order of preference will depend on the storm location.

Design/Construction Specifications:  1. FS personnel will direct the work.    2. Immediately upon receiving heavy rain and during significant spring snowmelt the FS will send out patrols to identify road hazard conditions Œ obstructions such as rocks, sediment, washouts, and plugged culverts, so the problems can be corrected before they worsen or jeopardize forest road users.   3. The road patrols shall bring in heavy equipment necessary to mechanically remove any obstructions from the roads and culvert inlets and catch basins where necessary.  All excess material and debris removed from the drainage system shall be placed outside of the bank-full stream channel where it cannot re-enter the stream.

Purpose of Treatment:

Roads within the Carlton Complex Fire contain drainage structures that cross both perennial and intermittent streams and dry gullies located in watersheds that have a moderate and high burn severity.  These streams and gullies now have the potential for increased runoff and debris flows.  These increases in flows pose a threat to the existing crossings which may result in plugging culverts or exceeding their maximum flow capacity.  If these flows plug drainage structures, the result will likely be additional erosion and debris further down the drainage due to the failures of the fill slopes of the roads and roads washing out caused by the flow travelling down the roadway. 

There is an immediate and future threat to travelers along these roads within the burned area due to the increased potential for rolling and falling rock from burned slopes and increased potential for falling trees, flash floods and mudflows.  The post-fire flooding will threaten to interrupt access to visitors, local residents, and Forest Service personnel who are implementing treatments.  With the loss of vegetation, normal storm frequencies and magnitudes can more easily initiate rill and gully erosion on the slopes and it is likely that this runoff will cover the roads or cause washouts.  These events make for hazardous access especially along and below steep slopes.

The purpose of the monitoring is to evaluate the condition of roads and bridges for motorized access and to identify and implement additional work needed to maintain and/or repair damage to road surfaces and flow conveyance structures (culverts, rolling dips, ditches) along roads in order to provide safe access across FS lands.  Engineering and District personnel will survey the roads within the fire perimeter after high-intensity summer thunderstorms and spring snow-melt.  Survey will inspect road surface condition, ditch erosion, and culverts/inlet basins for capacity to accommodate runoff flows.

The BAER Team considered this treatment to be the minimum necessary to achieve a reduction in risk to the accumulated critical values of:   1. Human life and safety of visitors, private residents, and agency personnel  2. Property (Forest roads)  3. Hydrologic function (including riparian and stream channel stability)

Describe Treatment Effectiveness Monitoring:

Monitor the storm-patrol response time to ensure objectives are being met.  Identify the type of storm event that mobilizes material.   Protection/Safety Treatments PS01 ŒSafety Signs General Description: This treatment is for the installation of burned area warning signs and road delineators. Burned area signs warn the public about possible dangers associated with a burned area on major entry points into the burned area and developed recreation sites.  It shall contain language specifying items to be aware of when entering a burn area such as falling trees and limbs, rolling rocks, and flash floods.

Road delineators are reflective devices mounted in a series along the edge of roadway where there is danger adjacent to the roadway to help indicate the roadway alignment and ensure driver safety.

Suitable Sites: Refer to BAER Treatment Map.

Detailed Design/Construction Specifications:  1. Traffic Warning and Road Closure Signs shall conform to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and shall be installed per Federal Highway Safety Standards. 2. Burned Area warning signs along Highway 20 shall measure, at a minimum, 4 feet by 4 feet and consist of 0.08ﬂ aluminum, sheeted in high intensity yellow with black letters and/or meet WSDOT Standards.  The BURNED AREA lettering shall be a minimum of 5 inches in height and all remaining lettering shall be a minimum of 3.5 inches in height. 3. Bridge delineators shall conform to Type 3 object marker standards established by the MUTCD.  Road delineators shall conform to MUTCD and the ﬁSign and Poster Guidelines for the Forest Serviceﬂ (EM-7100-15). 4. Burned Area warning signs at entrances to National Forest lands shall measure, at a minimum, 30 inches by 36 inches and consist of 0.08ﬂ aluminum, sheeted in high intensity yellow with black letters and/or meet WSDOT Standards.  The BURNED AREA lettering shall be a minimum of 5 inches in height and all remaining lettering shall be a minimum of 3.5 inches in height. 

Purpose of Treatment:

The purpose of this treatment is to provide safety to the motorists of upcoming road dangers and/or objects.  The BAER Team considered this treatment to be the minimum necessary to achieve a reduction in risk to the accumulated critical values of:   1. Human life and safety of visitors, private residents, and agency personnel

Protection/Safety Treatments (SW Cartlon Portion)

Treatment #PS1 Œ Closure and Warning Signs: Fire closure bulletin boards will be installed on FSR 4010 upon enter National Forest along with two other locations at the ridgeline to be determined by the district. 

Warning signs will include Entering Burned Area, Stay on Roads and Trails on FSR 4010,4012100, 4013200 and 4330 and will be installed to meet Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) standards.

Support installation of ALERT precipitation stations - Field verification and expedited processing for the issuance of  temporary emergency Special Use Permits for stations on National Forest System lands. This includes resource to process the permit, help someone through the permitting process and provide the resource specialists to allow for rapid site clearance (e.g. Archaeologist for

SHPO clearance). 

Site selection will be function of burn severity and downstream values at risk. 

Closure Gates - install closure gates at locations to reduce the risk to public being caught in a debris/runoff event or being hit by fire-killed trees. Area closure signs will be included in the sign totals to inform users that a closure order is in place and highlight the post-fire hazards to people ignoring that order. 

Closure and Warning signs Œthe warning and closure signs on gates will help to provide both technical closure information and warning information to potential Forest users.  Pump, sanitize, close and lock vault toilet restroom facilities at recreation use sites that could be impacted by post-fire floods.  This will help to minimize the risk to the facilities along with reducing the potential for downstream sanitary problems.  For the south part of the Carlton Fire this includes two CXTs (Foggy Dew Campground), one single vault toilet (Black Canyon SnowPlay Area) and one double vault toilet (South Fork Gold Creek SnowPlay Area). 

Describe Treatment Effectiveness Monitoring: District personnel will monitor or check signs after events to ensure that they will be effective for the future.

I. 

Monitoring Narrative: (Describe the monitoring needs, what treatments will be monitored, how they will be monitored, and when monitoring will occur.  A detailed monitoring plan must be submitted as a separate document to the Regional BAER coordinator.)

A. Treatment Effectiveness Monitoring (L03 Seeding) 1. Survey understory plant and soil cover using the line-point intercept method on two permanently marked 10-meter transects, placed two meters apart (parallel to the road), with sampling points placed at 20-cm intervals along each transect (50 sampling points per transect). At each sampling point, we will record all understory plants species intercepted by a descending vertical pin, including shrubs, grasses, and forbs. We will also record cover at the soil surface (mosses/lichens, litter, wood, rock, bare soil, etc.). Tree species will be included in the line-point intercept surveys if the sampled individual is a seedling (dbh < 1 cm).   2. Estimate plant species richness (native and exotic) by making a list of all plant species found within the 20-m2 area bounded by the sampling transects (ﬁsampling areaﬂ in figure 1). This list will include all species encountered by the line-point intercept surveys as well as additional species that are found between the two transects. Species are defined as occurring within the 20-m2 area if they are rooted within the area or overhang the area (would cast a shadow on the plot with the sun directly overhead).  3. Quantify density of diffuse knapweed and Dalmatian toadflax by counting each live stem that is rooted within the 20-m2 area between the two sampling transects used for assessing plant cover. Each stem, regardless of height, that is rooted within the sampling area will be counted and recorded on data sheets. If plant densities are very high, counts from a smaller area may be used as long as the area sampled is recorded.

B.  Why is the Treatment /Activity Reasonable, within Policy (identify Agency land management plan), and Cost Effective? Monitoring of treated areas is reasonable, as it well provides the agency with valuable information about the effectiveness of prescribed treatments and data could be used in planning for future projects.

Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest

Central Washington 2014 Wildfires Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) August 16, 2014

Mills Canyon Assessment Summary The BAER team has completed its on-the-ground assessment of the 22,006-acre Mills Canyon Fire. Because the fire burned National Forest lands, along with other federal and non-federal lands, interdisciplinary and interagency coordination occurred throughout the process. The U.S. Geological Survey provided support through their landslide hazard program. landslides.usgs.gov/hazards/postfire_debrisflow/2014/20140708mills/

Technical reports have been submitted by BAER team specialists who are experienced in conducting rapid assessments and analyses. They focused on "values at risk" that could be affected by flash floods or other weather-related events. What follows is a summary of the team's reports.

VALUES AT RISK: The Mill™s Canyon Fire area values at risk include:  capital investments in infrastructure, e.g. roads, culverts, and communication sites  water quality and aquatic/riparian species, e.g. designated critical habitat for Columbia River steelhead, Upper Columbia spring Chinook salmon, and bull trout  botanical protected species and the Thompson™s Clover Research Natural Area, winter range, and soil productivity  downstream properties, residences, and infrastructure HUMAN LIFE/SAFETY and PROPERTY: In valley bottom areas and in steep burned drainages throughout and downstream from burned areas, the team identified potential threats to life, safety, and property. Residents and other road users will be exposed to increased risk of flooding and debris flow. 

Houses and other structures, driveways, other private property, and Forest Service roads in valley bottoms adjacent to or in the flood-prone areas or near stream channels are at increased risk for flooding and debris flows. In several locations, roads intersect steep dissected canyons and are at increased risk of damage from debris flows. 

ROADS: The Mills Canyon Fire can be separated into two categories in its transportation system: a) maintenance "level 1" roads that run mid-slope off the main collector system and have been closed at the roads™ entrances with physical barriers, and b) steep maintenance "level 2" roads that dissect the watersheds connecting the Mills Canyon and Dinkelman Canyon floodplains with the surrounding ridgelines or upper watershed features. Both BAER Report:  Mills Canyon Assessment Summary Page 2 of 3  canyons have a history of debris flow or sediment movement caused by post-fire events and other naturally occurring events.  Field surveys have confirmed:  the potential for overtopping of undersized culverts  debris flows overtopping or partially washing out downstream road sections  the potential for surface water to travel along a road prism, increasing sedimentation and ﬁbulkingﬂ of road-generated surface flows  sediment movement from the adjacent canyon side slopes can deposit debris within the road prism and fill drainage structures such as drain dips and sags. This can further damage road infrastructure and redirect run-off in less stable areas. HYDROLOGY: The BAER team expects that primary watershed responses of the Mills Canyon Fire area will include a) an initial flush of ash, b) rill and gully erosion in drainages and on steep slopes within the burned area, c) flash floods with increase peak flows, and d) sediment transport and deposition. The watershed responses will be dependent on the occurrence of storm and melt events, and will be greatest with initial storm events. The disturbances will become less evident as vegetation is reestablished, providing ground cover and increasing surface roughness. However, the nature of the watersheds within the burn area makes them susceptible to large runoff events.

FISHERIES: The Entiat River and Roaring Creek currently support runs of Upper Columbia River summer steelhead (endangered), Upper Columbia River Spring Chinook salmon (endangered), Columbia River bull trout (threatened) and their designated Critical Habitat, as well as coho salmon, sockeye salmon, and Pacific lamprey.

Potential post-fire effects on the Entiat Watershed include increased water temperature, peak flows and channel scour, surface erosion and sediment delivery, and landslides and debris flows. These post-fire effects may threaten the survival of Endangered Species Act-listed fish eggs, fry, juveniles, and adults downstream of the fire. Effects may also alter habitat and channel conditions. Because of the proximity of steep drainages within the fire area (Mills Canyon, Dinkelman Canyon, Roaring Creek) the potential for detrimental impacts to listed fish habitat is high.

BOTANY: Populations of two USFS Region 6 Sensitive plants (Thompson™s clover and long-sepal globemallow), and one Survey and Manage plant (mountain ladies slipper, Cypripedium montanum) were burned by the Mills Canyon Fire.

Four noxious weeds are documented within the vicinity of the sensitive plant populations: Dalmatian toadflax (Wash. State Class B), spotted knapweed and diffuse knapweed (Wash. State Class B), and cheatgrass. Dalmatian toadflax spreads via seeds and rhizomes, and each plant may produce a half-million seeds. The seeds are small, about the size of poppy seeds, and are easily distributed through the air as the flower stem is blown in the wind. Diffuse and spotted knapweeds and cheatgrass spread via seeds that maintain viability for at least 10 years.   BAER Report:  Mills Canyon Assessment Summary Page 3 of 3

SOILS: High soil burn severity in the burned area is evident on steep slopes that have lost nearly all canopy cover with ground cover consisting largely of rock fragments and sparse remnants of grass or small plants. These soil conditions result in increased magnitude and frequency of damaging debris flows.

Ardenmont soils have a high potential for damage by fire. There is a relatively high erosion factor (Kw) of 0.32 to 0.24. The forest floor is covered with a 3 cm layer of needles and twigs from Douglas-fir, grand fir, western larch, and ponderosa pine over many fine roots and fungal mycelia. Much of the Mills Canyon area has been previously burned Œ by the Dinkelman Fire in 1988 and the Swakane Fire in 2010. Post-fire events from both fires included substantial debris flows; there is a long history of jammer logging prior to the Dinkelman Fire. Much of the soil resource has already been subject to high erosion rates with the loss of its topsoil layer.

GEOLOGY: Landslides have occurred in the past on steep slopes with Ardenmont soils; e.g. one on a north-facing slope south of Mills Canyon, and the other in the headwaters of Spencer Canyon. Basin and segment hazard and volume probabilities have been provided by the USGS Landslide Hazards Program: landslides.usgs.gov/hazards/postfire_debrisflow/2014/20140708mills/

CULTURAL: Discussions with the forest archaeologists indicate there are limited heritage resources within the fire perimeter; no emergency mitigation treatments are needed at this time.

Date    BAER Analysis Briefing:

Chiwaukum Creek Fire 09/08/2014    __________________  Chiwaukum Creek Fire Assessment Briefing  ::  Page 1 of 2  ____________________________________

The Chiwaukum Creek Fire started on July 15, 2014 and burned 13,893 acres in the Nason Creek Watershed and

Wenatchee River Watershed south of Lake Wenatchee in central Washington. Of the total fire area, 11,656 acres are National Forest System lands and 2,237 acres are in private ownership. Most of the burned acres and high soil burn severity occurred in the

Chiwaukum Creek and Tumwater Canyon areas, subwatersheds of the Wenatchee River Watershed.

A Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team on September 8 submitted a request for $99,707 in funding for risk-mitigation projects to improve road drainage, install ALERT storm warning systems, initiate storm patrol, install burned area hazard signs and gates, and initiate emergency detection and rapid response for identified hazard areas.

After the fire, several debris flows occurred in Chiwaukum Creek after relatively small rainstorms, and similar debris flows are expected from Thompson Creek and Hatchery Creek, with more expected in Chiwaukum Creek. Flooding and debris in the area could cause culvert blockage and failure; portions of roadways could be lost with the culvert failures, blocking exit options for persons in the area.

In the Tumwater Campground area, several debris flows have already occurred upstream of the campground. 

One storm created an ash-laden flow adjacent to the campground, and similar problems are expected in or near the campground.

Burned trees adjacent to area trails are hazardous to anyone in the area, and debris flows along trails could risk safety of hikers and cut off escape. At the backcountry Chiwaukum Creek campsite, burn severity of nearby slopes is mostly moderate, but debris flows develop quickly and could surprise hikers, leaving no options for escape.

Private residences in Chiwaukum Canyon are at risk. 

Several post-fire debris flows have already occurred in Chiwaukum Creek, even after relatively mild rainfall, and more debris flows from Chiwaukum Creek are expected. These could block culverts and cause roadway failures Œ and there is no other way out from these areas.

Private residences in Chiwaukum Estates above Thompson Creek are also at risk; much of the area burned at high-to-moderate severity. Road erosion and culvert failure are expected, and portions of the roadway could be lost. There is no alternative way out from the area.

Also at risk is the Hatchery Creek residential tract, which is sited on an alluvial fan on both sides of Hatchery Creek downslope of the Hatchery Creek Road. The tributary south of Hatchery Creek has produced at least one recent debris flow, and more are expected.

Also at risk is private property in Chiwaukum Canyon and in Chiwaukum Estates above Thompson Creek. These properties are at risk of debris flows, erosion, and increased runoff caused by storms and snowmelt; road access into and out of these areas could be blocked.   BAER Analysis Briefing:

Chiwaukum Creek Fire 09/08/2014    __________________  Chiwaukum Creek Fire Assessment Briefing  ::  Page 2 of 2 In the Tumwater Campground area, burn severity was approximately 50 percent low and 50 percent moderate. Sewage lagoons are adjacent to slopes burned at approximately 70 percent low and 30 percent moderate severity.

All roads in the burned area are at risk of falling rocks or trees blocking the roadway, blocked culverts, and debris flows that could leave sediment on the roadway or result in loss of parts of the roads. Flooding and debris flows could also cause problems on sections of Skinney Creek and Highway 2.

Water quality in the area will be negatively affected by ash, sediment, and debris; sediment is likely to flow through burned area streams into the Wenatchee River and beyond. 

Post-fire effects to the Wenatchee River and the Chiwaukum Creek watershed could include increased water temperatures, peak flows, and channel scour, along with landslides and debris flows. Chiwaukum Creek experienced some high-to-moderate burn severity, and increased sedimentation could negatively affect the bull trout population.

Effects on spring Chinook and summer steelhead habitat upstream of the Chiwaukum Complex should be minimal. Negative effects to fish species in the Wenatchee River are possible, but impacts should be minimal. Damage to fisheries on Chiwaukum Creek, though, is likely (50 to 90 percent occurrence within 1-3 years).

Soil loss caused by post-wildfire erosion in some areas will result in a long-term loss of soil productivity. Natural recovery of ground cover vegetation is likely over the next 3-5 years, but in areas that were severely burned, pre-fire conditions will not be restored until a new forest stand is established.

Planned Forest Service projects within the Chiwaukum Fire area focus on the safety of persons traveling on US Highway 2, FSR 7905, and FSR 7909 within developed recreation sites and along trails within and downstream of the burn area. Post-fire work will also include signage, area closures, repair or relocation of campground facilities, fire closure signs, and installation of precipitation monitoring stations within the fire perimeter.

Other planned projects will ensure safe access within the drainage and reduce road-related hazards. Some road work will reduce the risk of runoff downstream of the fire and address safety issues where debris flows meet a drainage structures. Many road and trail treatments are planned or already under way, and all risk-reduction activities will be monitored.

Duncan Fire 09/08/2014    _________________________  Duncan Fire Assessment Brief  ::  Page 1 of 2  ____________________________________

The Duncan Fire started on July 16, 2014 and burned 12,691 acres of National Forest System lands north of Wenatchee, Washington, in the Entiat River watershed on the Entiat Ranger District. 

Within the total burn area, 2,921 acres (23%) were assessed at very low or unburned severity, 2,903 acres (23%) were low severity, 4,982 acres (39%) burned at moderate severity, and 1,890 acres (15%) burned at high severity.

On September 8 a Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) request (2500-8) was submitted for $285,299 in funding for hazard mitigation projects.

The BAER team identified numerous threats to human life, safety, and property in its assessment of post-fire conditions in the Duncan Fire burn area. These threats included blocked culverts on Forest Service roads and other potential road-related hazards that could result from post-fire rainfall and erosion in and below the burned area. Many roads in the area are at risk of falling rocks or trees blocking the roadway, flooding and debris flows, or washed-out sections of road.

Burned trees along trails also pose risks to users; trail treads, retaining walls, and drainage features were also identified as hazards or potential hazards. The trailhead at Silver Falls could be affected by blocked culverts, and the team noted that bridges along the trail could be threatened by burned debris carried downstream by heavy rains or flash flooding. Some of the structures and other features at Silver Falls Campground were damaged by the fire, and the area around the North Entiat Trailhead burned at moderate-to-high severity.

Though most of the slopes above the Riverside recreational tract were not severely burned, heavy rains could cause problems in the Jungle Creek area. Debris flows have already occurred in the Pope Creek area, and more are expected. Post-fire debris flows could increase dramatically, eroding stream channels and moving sediment and debris in the area. The BAER team cautioned that structures could be damaged and road access cut off.

In the area of the North Fork Campground, flooding and debris flows have already occurred from Pope Creek Œ even after light rainstorms. Similar debris flows from the North Entiat River are likely. Three Creek Campground may be at risk of post-fire effects, but the Cottonwood Campground, Spruce Grove Campground, and Cottonwood Guard Station are considered low-risk.

Entiat Valley Road (FSR 51), Shady Pass Road (FSR 5900), and many other Forest Service roads were damaged by the fire or are threatened by heavy runoff and debris flows. Blocked culverts could damage stream crossings or intersections, causing heavy sedimentation below the road. On August 14, on FSR 5902 where it crossed Pope Creek, rainstorms triggered runoff with moving sediment that scoured Pope Creek, moving the main channel back to historic channels and damaging the Entiat River Road (FSR 51). 

This event illustrated the potential for damage of historic recreation residences in the area.    BAER Analysis Brief:

Duncan Fire 09/08/2014    _________________________  Duncan Fire Assessment Brief  ::  Page 2 of 2

The Duncan Fire lies entirely within the Entiat River watershed. 

The BAER team expects that rainstorms and burned-area erosion will result in an initial flush of ash downstream, erosion in drainages and on steep slopes, flash flooding, and debris flows within the watershed. The severity of these effects will depend on storms Œ and on snowmelt Œ and will likely be worse with early fall storms. Once the vegetation on slopes becomes re-established, providing ground cover and reducing erosion, the storm effects will moderate.

The BAER team identified subwatersheds of particular concern, including Silver Creek, Pope Creek, Duncan Creek, and the North Fork.

Post-wildfire erosion will cause soil loss in the area, resulting in long-term loss of soil productivity. Natural recovery of ground cover is expected over the next 3-5 years in most areas, but under severely burned forest stands, the full function of pre-fire litter and duff will probably not be present until a new forest stand is established.

The Entiat River supports summer steelhead, spring Chinook and coho salmon, bull trout, redband/rainbow trout, westslope cutthroat, and Pacific lamprey. 

Increased erosion and sediment in the Entiat River is likely, and may risk some of the populations in the fishery, particularly bull trout and Chinook salmon. Post-fire conditions and weather-related incidents are less likely to pose risk to area steelhead. 

Road treatments are planned to protect other critical values in the area, and will also provide long-term benefits to the Entiat watershed and its fish populations. 

Protective measures are planned for about a dozen campgrounds and numerous trail segments and bridges. Rainstorm monitoring will be improved with the installation of Automated Local Evaluation in Real Time (ALERT) stations to provide precipitation data for flood forecasting and early warning. Numerous closure and warning signs and some gates will be installed, and restroom facilities at recreation sites will be cleaned, closed, or moved to reduce risk of downstream contamination and health hazards. Some felling of hazard trees may also be necessary.

Many road and trail treatments are planned or already under way, and all risk-reduction activities will be monitored.

Little Bridge Creek Interim 10/09/2014

Little Bridge Creek Interim Briefing  ::  Page 1 of 5  ____________________________________ Team Leader: TJ Clifford, Boise District BLM Contact: Stuart Woolley swoolley@fs.fed.us 509-664-9332

Little Bridge Creek Fire Okanogan County, Washington Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, Methow Valley District The Little Bridge Creek Fire started on August 2, 2014 and burned 4,934 acres of

National Forest System lands. It was contained on August 25 at a cost of $12,518,000.

Elevations across the burned area range from 2,800 to about 6,500 feet. Vegetation types include dry pine forests, riparian habitats, mid-elevation mesic forest, and high-elevation mixed-conifer montane forests. Primary conifer species include ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, larch, lodgepole pine, and Engelmann spruce, with subalpine fir found on the highest peaks. Aspen also occurs throughout most forest types.

The burned area includes 6.4 miles of intermittent streams and 6.9 miles of perennial streams, along with 7.1 miles of roads and 3 miles of trails. Of the total fire area, 2,889 (59 percent) were burned at low severity, 774 (16 percent) at moderate severity, and 794 (16 percent) at high severity. Approximately 1,570 acres were assessed with water-repellent soils. Across the burned area, soil erosion hazard ratings were identified at low hazard for 33 acres, moderate hazard for 72 acres, and high hazard for 4,593 acres, with an erosion potential calculated at 3.3 tons per acre and a sediment potential of 528 to 603 cubic yards per square mile.

This BAER assessment addresses post-fire conditions on NFS lands of the Methow Valley Ranger District on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. 

The Little Bridge Fire burned north of the Twisp River in the Little Bridge drainage. The BAER team included interagency personnel from the USFS, NPS,

BIA, FWS, and BLM, representing engineering, hydrology, fisheries, soils, cultural resources, vegetation, and GIS. An in-briefing on September 2 was held to strategize field assessments and field assessments were conducted from

September 3-9.

Little Bridge Creek Interim Briefing  ::  Page 3 of 5 Hydrologic design factors:

The Little Bridge Creek Fire burned within the Twisp River Watershed, and the percentage of the watershed burned was used to characterize post-fire hydrologic response. About 21 percent of the Little Bridge Creek watershed burned, with only 7 percent at high/moderate severity. About 5 percent of the Middle Twisp River watershed burned, with only 2 percent high/moderate severity. The stream with the greatest potential to be affected by the fire is Little Bridge Creek. Most of the riparian vegetation is intact, which reduces the risk of short- and long-term detrimental effects to hydrologic function. Estimated vegetative recovery period is 3 to 5 years. 

Little Bridge Creek Fire perimeter 08/20/2014

Identified values-at-risk

Roads: Risks to human safety exist from flooding, hazard trees, and rockfall along roads downstream or downslope of burned areas, especially those with moderate-high burn severity. Forest Road 4415000 is on the northwest side of the fire, and Little Bridge Creek flows between this road and the burned area. Risk to road infrastructure includes  BAER Analysis Briefing:

Little Bridge Creek Interim 10/09/2014

Little Bridge Creek Interim Briefing  ::  Page 4 of 5 expected flooding of the creek and resulting lateral instability of the channel affecting the roadway. Forest Roads 4415100 and 4415130 and 4415140 are in proximity to Canyon Creek. 

Flooding is expected, with resulting lateral instability of the channel affecting these roads.

Fisheries and riparian habitat: Steelhead and bull trout and their designated Critical Habitat are at risk from post-fire runoff, erosion, and sediment delivery, which could negatively affect steelhead populations and cause degradation of habitat. There are 0.1 miles of designated Critical Habitat within the fire area, but there are 16 miles of critical habitat within 3 miles of the fire perimeter. Designated Critical Habitat for bull trout includes 2.4 miles inside the fire area and 32 miles within 3 miles of the fire perimeter. Hydrologic function of hillslopes and channels may be affected by the loss of soil cover and structure, decreased infiltration, hillslope erosion and sediment delivery to stream channels, and increased stream channel runoff. Flooding and debris flows are expected. About 32 percent of the fire burned at moderate to high severity, but riparian habitat within Little Bridge remains mostly intact, which will help buffer fire effects.

Non-forested native or naturalized communities: The slow natural regeneration following moderate-to-high burn severity with consumption of the seed bank threatens the native or naturalized communities of grass/shrub steppe habitat. Several noxious weed types exist within the burned area, but a recently discovered population of yellow toadflax at the bottom of Little Bridge Creek poses a new threat to the native plant communities in the area and in the Methow Valley.

Forested native or naturalized communities: Significant tree mortality occurred in some areas, and the natural regeneration will be delayed by loss of the canopy, seed bank, and organic soil layer.

Soil productivity: The BAER team identified a high probability of immediate detrimental soil displacement in areas affected by moderate and high burn severity. The loss of effective groundcover and above-ground organic matter will leave soils susceptible to erosion for 3 to 5 years in high-severity areas and 2 years in moderate.

Planned treatments:

Invasive plants and weed assessments will be conducted in FY2015 for Early Detection and Rapid Response (EDRR) on any new infestation  within the fire perimeter. 

Treatments will occur at proper phenology of each species to ensure maximum control. 

The fire area will be assessed for new infestations of noxious weeds; assessments from FY2015 will establish baseline data to be tracked through the Methow Valley Ranger District GIS databases and will be used to determine the priority, level, and intensity of control for new infestations for one year after the fire containment date. Integrating weed projects with Okanogan County, Cooperative Weed Management Area on state and private lands will reduce noxious weed populations and  weed control costs to all cooperators. Treatment sites will be evaluated annually for the next three years.  BAER Analysis Briefing:

Little Bridge Creek Interim 10/09/2014

Little Bridge Creek Interim Briefing  ::  Page 5 of 5 Storm patrols will identify road problems and clear, clean, and/or block damaged roads. Patrollers will focus on roads and bridges with the most traffic, those that are of more value to the transportation system, and roads with high-risk structures prone to storm damage. Targeted roads include Little Bridge Creek Road and Little Bridge Saddle Road. Patrols will identify obstructions such as rocks, sediment, washouts, and plugged culverts, and will remove obstructions and other hazards.

Roads within the fire area have drainage structures that cross streams in areas with a moderate-to-low burn severity, with potential for increased runoff and debris flows. 

Storms could result in plugging culverts or exceeding  maximum flow capacity, causing additional erosion and debris farther down the drainage caused by failures of the fill slopes of the roads.

Rolling and falling rock from burned slopes also risks human safety, along with the risk of falling trees, flash floods, and mudflows. Post-fire flooding can interrupt access, and even normal storm frequencies and magnitudes can easily initiate rill and gully erosion and cover roads or cause washouts. 

Monitoring will identify work needed to maintain and/or repair damage to road surfaces and drainage structures to provide safe access.

Safety and warning signs on Forest Road 4415000 near Sheep Creek and on 4415100 near 4415115 will identify of the dangers associated with a burned area at major entry points into the burned area.

Ongoing monitoring will ensure that post-fire projects are completed as prescribed. Effectiveness monitoring for area closures is included to determine whether additional law enforcement presence or public information is needed to achieve compliance and ensure public safety.

Upper Falls Fire 10/13/2014

Upper Falls Fire Briefing  ::  Page 1 of 3  ____________________________________  Team Leader: TJ Clifford, Boise District BLM Contact: Stuart Woolley swoolley@fs.fed.us 509-664-9332  Upper Falls Fire Okanogan County, Washington Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, Methow Valley District The Upper Falls Fire started August 5, 2014 and burned 8,378 acres of National Forest System (NFS) lands in the Upper and Lower Chewuch River watersheds. The fire was contained on August 25 at a cost of $5,255,000.

The fire began as a combination of several wildfires ignited by lightning about 17 miles north of Winthrop between Falls Creek and Farewell Creek. The fire burned in steep and rugged terrain in dense stands of subalpine fir and Douglas-fir with a high percentage of bug-killed trees.

Elevations throughout the burned area range from 3,800 to about 7,500 feet. Vegetation include- dry pine forests on south-facing slopes, riparian habitats, mid-elevation mesic forest, and high elevation mixed conifer montane forests. Primary conifer species include ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, larch, lodgepole pine, and Engelmann spruce, with subalpine fir found on the upper slopes. Aspen also occurs throughout most forest types. 

The area includes 3.9 miles of perennial streams and 13.6 miles of intermittent streams, with 3.9 miles of roads and 8.1 miles of trails. 

Burn severity by watershed: Watershed Low Moderate High Falls Creek 2,452 1,785 1,204 Lake Creek 410 414 370 Total 2,862 2,199 1,574

The BAER team assessed 2,830 acres in the burn area with water-repellent soils. Soil erosion hazard ratings included 17 acres at low hazard, 771 acres at moderate hazard, and 7,419 acres at high hazard rating, with an overall erosion potential at 4.4 tons per acre across the area. Sediment potential was assessed at 603 to 804 cubic yards per square mile. Vegetative recovery is estimated at 3 to 5 years.

The BAER team included interagency personnel from the USFS, NPS, BIA, FWS, and

BLM, representing Engineering, Hydrology, Fisheries, Soils, Cultural Resources, Vegetation, and Geographic Information Systems. On September 2 an in-briefing was held with officials and staff from the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest's  Methow Valley Ranger District to strategize field assessments, which were conducted between September 3 and 9 by the team.  BAER Analysis Briefing:

Upper Falls Fire 10/13/2014

Upper Falls Fire Briefing  ::  Page 2 of 3

Identified values-at-risk:

Road safety: Hazards exist from flooding, hazard trees, and rockfall along roads that downstream or downslope of burned areas, especially those with moderate-high burn severity. The team identified risks to major NFS roads at intermittent and perennial drainages; undersized culverts are expected to plug or overtop and could severely damage road infrastructure. Forest Road 5140000 is a paved road along the southwest side of the fire area; six significant drainage crossings along this road are susceptible to damage.

The team also identified risks to Forest Road 5140400 at intermittent and perennial drainages.

Steelhead, Spring Chinook and Bull Trout and designated Critical Habitat may be threatened by post-fire runoff, erosion, and sediment delivery. There is no designated Critical Habitat within the fire area, but there are 2 miles of critical habitat (steelhead and salmon) and 15 miles of critical habitat (bull trout) within 3 miles of the fire perimeter.

Riparian habitat is at risk for damage to hydrologic function of hillslopes and channels as a result of the loss of soil cover and structure, decreased infiltration, hillslope erosion and sediment delivery to stream channels, and increased stream channel runoff. 

Flooding and debris flows are expected. Channel widening and excessive gully formation are likely. About 49 percent of the fire burned at moderate-to-high severity, creating risk to riparian areas from increased stream flows, channel erosion, and loss of grass, forb, and shrub components in areas of moderate-to-high soil burn severity.

Native or naturalized communities in non-forested areas will experience slow natural regeneration in areas of moderate-to-high burn severity. Shrub and grass communities are very limited within the high-elevation areas; known noxious and invasive weed populations exist within and adjacent to the burned area, and they will compete aggressively with native species.Significant tree mortality occurred in forested areas of the fire, and natural regeneration will be delayed by the loss of forest canopy, seed bank, and organic soil layer. The loss of effective ground cover and above-ground organic matter will leave the soil resource susceptible to erosion for 3 to 5 years in high-severity areas (1,628 acres) and 2 years in moderate-severity areas (2,481 acres).

Planned treatments:

Invasive plants and weed assessments will be conducted in FY2015 for Early Detection and Rapid Response (EDRR) on any new infestation  within the fire perimeter. 

Treatments will occur at proper phenology of each species to ensure maximum control. 

The fire area will be assessed for new infestations of noxious weeds; assessments from

FY2015 will establish baseline data to be tracked through the Methow Valley Ranger District GIS databases and will be used to determine the priority, level, and intensity of control for new infestations for one year after the fire containment date. Integrating weed projects with Okanogan County, Cooperative Weed Management Area on state and private lands will reduce noxious weed populations and  weed control costs to all cooperators. Treatment sites will be evaluated annually for the next three years. Known BAER Analysis Briefing:

Upper Falls Fire 10/13/2014

Upper Falls Fire Briefing  ::  Page 3 of 3 locations for noxious weeds are limited within the burn area, but there is a very high risk for new infestations within the fire perimeter because of disturbance caused by the wildfire and the suppression equipment used to fight the fire. Canada thistle is known to cover 19 acres within the burn perimeter. 

Species on the early detection list include diffuse knapweed, white top (hoary cress),

Dalmatian toadflax, and oxeye daisy. Orange hawkweed is a primary species of concern for invasion of the burned area; other species on the early-detection list include Bohemian knotweed, spurge flax, and hound™s tongue. Manual and chemical treatments are planned for weeds within the fire area on NFS lands.

Culvert removals are planned at stream crossings on Forest Service Road 5140410. 

The stream channel will be reconstructed with stream simulation material to reduce the risk of head cutting and scour through the new channel. The treatment is planned for undersized pipe crossings on maintenance level 1 roads, which are closed to all motorized traffic when the cost of replacing culverts exceeds the benefit to the road system. Monitoring will be handled USFS staff, who will check the site after high-intensity thunderstorms and after spring runoff.

Regular storm patrols will monitor for plugged culverts and washed-out roads and will clear damaged roads. Patrols will focus on roads and bridges with the most traffic, including Forest Road 5140000 (Falls Creek) and 5140320 (Sheep Creek crossing at

Falls Creek).

There is an immediate and future threat to travelers along these roads within the burned area from rolling and falling rocks and falling trees, flash floods, and mudflows. Post-fire flooding could interrupt access, and even  normal storms can initiate rill and gully erosion on slopes. Storm patrols will evaluate roads and bridges for motorized access and will identify work needed to maintain road surfaces, culverts, and bridges. Patrols will inspect road surface condition, ditch erosion, and culverts/inlet basins for capacity to accommodate runoff flows.

Safety signs will be installed at major entry points into the burned area, including Forest Road 5140000 at the edge of the fire.

Ongoing monitoring will ensure that post-fire projects are completed as prescribed. 

Effectiveness monitoring for area closures is included to determine whether additional law enforcement presence or public information is needed to achieve compliance and ensure public safety.

Explanation of Requested Item Who Completes Section 2 Use available natural resource, economic, and social, information, including the EWP Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS), to briefly describe the effects of the alternatives to the proposed action including the ﬁno actionﬂ alternative. 

Typically, the proposed action and no action are the alternatives considered for EWP recovery measures due to the focus on repairing or preventing damages within a watershed. However, in cases where additional alternatives are considered, include all pertinent information to adequately address the additional alternatives (e.g., proposed action would be bio-engineering for bank stabilization, no action alternative, and an additional alternative may be riprap for bank stabilization). 

Do not leave blanks where a consideration is not applicable, use NA to indicate the factor was considered but not applicable for the alternative. 

NRCS completes with voluntary assistance from Sponsor. 2A List all resource concerns which are relevant to the area of the proposed action and alternatives. 

Refer to National Bulletin 450-5-8 TCH-COMPLETING AND FILING MEASUREMENT UNITS FOR RESOURCE CONCERNS IN THE FIELD OFFICE TECHNICAL GUIDE (FOTG). Note: the affected area may extend beyond the construction foot print (ex. where water quality or water rights are affected downstream of the site). 2B Provide a brief description of the present condition of each resource concern listed in 2A. Quantify conditions where possible. Reference accompanying photo documentation.  2C Briefly summarize the practice/system of practices being proposed, as well as the ﬁno actionﬂ alternative, and any other alternatives being considered.  The ﬁno actionﬂ alternative is the predicted future condition if no action is taken.   2D Document the efforts of the proposed action and alternatives for the considerations listed in 2A. Reference applicable quality criteria, information in the CPPE, and quantify effects whenever possible. 

Consider both long-term and short-term effects. Consider any effects which may be individually minor but cumulatively significant at a larger scale or over an extended time period. Clearly define the differences between proposed action, no action, and the other alternatives.   2E Enter Special Environmental Concerns for Clean Water Act Waters of the U.S., Coastal Zone Management Areas, Coral Reefs, Cultural Resources, Endangered and Threatened Species, Environmental Justice, Essential Fish Habitat, Fish and Wildlife Coordination, Floodplain Management, Invasive Species, Migratory Birds, Natural Areas, Prime and Unique Farmlands, Riparian Areas, Scenic Beauty, Wetlands, and Wild and Scenic Rivers for each alternative considered.  In the case where the selected alternative from Section 5A impacts a Special Environmental Concern, additional information, coordination, permitting or mitigation may be required and adequate documentation should be prepared and attached to the DSR to identify how NRCS or the Sponsor addressed the concern  2F Identify Property Protected both private and public, business losses and other economic impacts considered for each alternative.  Enter the dollar value of the potential future damages if no action is taken in the Future Damage (5) column. This would be the estimate of the value lost if the EWP recovery measure is not installed. Use the repair cost or damage dollar method to determine the estimate of future damages. The repair cost method uses the costs to return the impaired property, good, or services based on their original pre-event condition or value. The damage dollar method uses an estimate of the future damage to value (e.g. if the structure is condemned, then enter the value of the structure). 

Enter the estimated amount based upon existing information or information furnished by the sponsor, contractors or others with specific knowledge for recovery from natural disasters for each alternative considered. Often market values for properties or services can be obtained from personnel at the local county/parish tax assessment office. 

The DSI team needs to determine the Damage Factor (%) which is a coefficient that indicates the degree of damage reduction to a property that is attributed to the effect of the proposed EWP recovery measures. 

Use an appropriate estimate of how much of the damage the EWP recovery measure will avoid for the alternative being considered. If the recovery measures from a single site will prevent 100 percent of the damage use 100 percent. The Near Term Damage Reduction is the Future Damage ($) times the Damage Factor (%). Sum the Near Term Damage Reduction values to calculate the Total Near Term Damage Reduction. Enter the Net Benefit which is computed by subtracting the

Cost from section 3 from the total near term damage reduction. The economic section must be completed for each alternative considered. 

Attach additional sheets as necessary.  2G Enter information to describe the potential social impacts and considerations for each alternative. 

Answer Yes or No and any remarks necessary to adequately address each question. The information may be obtained through interviews with community leaders, government officials or sponsors.  Factors such as road closures, loss of water, electricity, access to emergency services are used when answering whether the community as a whole has been impaired. This information is part of the environmental evaluation portion of the DSR but may be pertinent in Section 4 regarding priorities. The Social Considerations Section must be completed for each alternative considered. Attach additional sheets as necessary.    2H Enter the Group Representation Information for the preferred alternative.Use the most recent census tract information based upon where the EWP recovery measures are located.

Tributaries that run into the

Methow are also in the burn area.No EffectWater quality may be impacted (increased sediment) as a result of the fire and future rainfall events. 

The proposed action will not have an adverse effect on the natural, cultural and recreational values of the  Methow River.  Water quality may be impacted as a result of the fire and future rainfall events unrelated to the proposed action.

Are the effects of the preferred alternative on the quality of the human environment likely to be highly controversial?No change from benchmarkIs the preferred alternative expected to significantly affect unique characteristics of the geographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural resources, park lands, prime farmlands, wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or ecologically critical areas?Does the preferred alternative have highly uncertain effects or involve unique or unknown risks on the human environment?The significance of an action must be analyzed in several contexts such as society as a whole (human, national), the affected region, the affected interests, and the locality. 

Refers to the severity of impact. Impacts may be both beneficial and adverse. A significant effect may exist even if the Federal agency believes that on balance the effect will be beneficial.  Significance cannot be avoided by terming an action temporary or by breaking it down into small component parts.

Landowners are encouraged to CAREFULLY walk their properties to assess the damages and potential risks. Potential problems resulting from fires may include:

Safety issues along property boundaries, roads and buildings. 

Significant increase in sediment delivery to stream channels

Surface and gully erosion on slopes and possible debris flows down draws

Loss of vegetation and forest cover which reduces grazing for livestock & wildlife, degrades habitat, and increases the risk of weed infestations

Hazards from insect infestations in the fire killed and fire stressed trees

When walking your property, look for items that may potentially plug stream channels and/or blocks, barbeques, propane tanks, lawn furniture, potted plants, etc.) can float in the event of a flash flood or debris flow. Additional runoff may cause channels to shift, creating additional erosion. 

Check and remove debris in and near draws and/or in and near culverts. This includes rocks, grass clippings, decking, structures, vegetation, fences across draws, etc. 

Secure and/or anchor all possible outdoor items. Move lawn furniture, barbeques, propane tanks, pool covers, etc. inside. 

Stream work and salvage removal may require special permitting. Please contact the Department of Natural Resources and Department of Fish and Wildlife for more information. 

It may be difficult to visualize the rebirth of a forest or rangeland following a wildfire. However, nature is well equipped for regenerating some fire resistant species such as ponderosa pine trees and shrub-steppe species. You may already notice some grasses and plants recovering on the landscape. Revegetation of burned areas is also imperative for restoring the health of the ecosystem. Some possible treatments include:

Grass seeding (quick establishment, weed suppression, and forage)

Forest tree planting (primarily ponderosa pine)

Riparian plantings along stream corridors

The Okanogan Conservation District is available to assist with site specific questions and provide assistance for landowners as they begin to restore the landscape following the fire. Please contact us at  (509) 422-0855 ext. 5 for more information.  8/27/2014  17

Restoration Needs for Lands Impacted by Carlton Complex Fire  Landowners looking for assistance with restoration of their lands should contact the Okanogan Conservation District.  The District is acting as a clearinghouse for private landowners seeking assistance with issues such as restoration of grazing lands, repair of fences, repair of irrigation systems, restoration of riparian trees and shrubs, general reseeding, or erosion control.  In the forested areas, issues may also include removal or chipping of burned materials, erosion control and replanting. 

At this time, there are limited funds available; however, the District is actively working together with the groups/agencies listed in box below to locate additional sources of both technical and financial assistance for private landowners. This group will likely grow as sources of assistance are located.  Receiving requests from landowners will help to focus the search for funding. 

Landowners seeking assistance should be prepared to provide the following information: Name Contact information (phone and e-mail)
