After Action Report Executive Summary During the afternoon hours of August 18, 2005 a rapid developing severe storm moved through the area.  The National Weather Service issued a Tornado Warning for the

County of Dane at 5:21 p.m.  The storm was monitored from the 911 Center and Dane County Emergency Management.  Amateur radio personnel were utilized in the

Emergency Management communication room to collect information from spotters in the field. Several funnel clouds were spotted throughout the Dane County area.  At approximately 6:15 p.m. a F3-F4 tornado, as defined by the National Weather Service, touched down in the Town of Dunn.  Its 17 mile track of devastation affected the Towns of Dunn, Pleasant Springs, Christiana, Albion, Dunkirk and the City of Stoughton leaving 69 homes destroyed, 84 homes with major damage and 220 received minor damage or were classified as affected. A copy of the tornado path is provided as an attachment. 

Twenty-three residents were injured and two deaths were contributed to the event. Debris was scattered across the landscape making entry into the affected areas difficult.  Gas leaks created the need for evacuation of several areas. Numerous emergency response agencies flooded into the area to provide assistance.  Thousands of volunteers would later respond to the needs of the communities.  The County Emergency Operation Center (EOC) was fully activated and staffed for five days.  Individual and Public losses climbed to over $33,693,384. The table below shows structural losses by jurisdiction and type.

A local State of Emergency was issued.  Federal assistance was requested and later denied.  The County and local affected jurisdictions would later work cooperatively with the Governor™s office to draft a letter of appeal. That appeal was also denied.  The area would later receive assistance from the U.S. Small Business Administration and the U.S. 

Department of Agriculture.  These were individual department disaster declarations.

The Small Business Administration would bring low interest loans for renters, homeowners, and businesses.  The Department of Agriculture programs are meant to provide assistance to farmers that sustained crop and agricultural building damage. The County earmarked $60,000 from the 2005 Community Development Block Grant program to assist affected jurisdictions with cost recovery for debris removal.

A Long Term Recovery Board was set up in September to address the unmet needs of the citizens affected by the event.  The mission of the Board is ﬁTo strengthen area-wide disaster long-term recovery efforts by the coordination and provision of spiritual, emotional and physical resources to those affected by disaster.ﬂ  The Board seeks to respond to unmet needs not satisfied by other relief systems.

The Board is composed of local elected officials or their designees from each of the affected jurisdictions.  Three affected citizens are also seated on the Board along with a representative from local clergy. The Board established a working relationship with the Stoughton Area Community Foundation (non-profit designation) to handle accounting and distribution of donated funds. The Board has established six Long Term Recovery Workgroups; Mental Health, Resource Coordination, Training and Support, Case Management, Finance, and Public Information. Operational and application review meetings are conducted weekly or at the call of the chair.  The Board has hired three case workers to assist with out reach and the application process for requesting financial assistance.  No donated funds are used for operational purposes.  A separate budget was established to support case management and resource coordination.  A  monthly U:\ems\SHARED\After Action Report-Stoughton Tornado.doc Last printed 2/14/2006 9:24 AM 3newsletter is utilized to inform affected citizens of upcoming events and opportunities.  A web site was also established.

The following information is current statistics for the Stoughton Area Tornado recovery.

Applications for Assistance received 125 Applicants Seen 110 Donations Awarded 85 Funds Awarded to Date $92,278.00 Monetary Donations to Date $320,000.00

The subsequent comments were collected from an ﬁAfter Actionﬂ review held on

September 29, 2005. Sixty individuals representing local government, response agencies, county departments, utilities, non-profit organizations, and state agencies attended. 

Agencies specific listening sessions were conducted too more closely identify issues pertinent to individual disciplines.

Warning: The outdoor warning system was activated four (4) times. The activation of the system was coordinated between the 911 Center and the Department of Emergency Management. 

Comments:

The ability to share information easily between the two departments for decision-making purposes on system activation worked well. 

Notification: The EOC was activated immediately following the 911 Center communiqué that a tornado was on the ground in the Stoughton area and they were receiving reports of damage. Staff was in the department monitoring the situation. EOC notification and activation was done immediately by the use of pager, e-mail, and Reverse 911. 

Comment:

EOC representatives stated that they had no problem receiving the notification.  That the notification system had worked well.  Many had received the notification by several sources. 

Comment: We need to identify a method in which we can convey EOC activation to affected communities during a disaster. 

Action:

Work with the 911 Center and community leaders to identify a method of activation notification and communication link. 

EOC Activation: The EOC is not permanently set up.  Therefore when it is fully activated there is time needed to set up phones, computers, radios, supplies, etc.

Comment:

Difficulty connecting phones.

Action:

Review phone diagrams. 

Review markings for plugging in phones. 

Action Step Achieved and Tested.

Comment:

Noise levels in the EOC makes it hard to hear while on the phone. 

Action:

Investigate the use of headsets to keep down noise.  U:\ems\SHARED\After Action Report-Stoughton Tornado.doc Last printed 2/14/2006 9:24 AM 4Comment:

Public Works, Highway and Transportation was unable to access voice mail. 

Action:

Set up phone system in EOC to accommodate voice mail capabilities for all represented agencies.

Comment:

Difficulty encountered in contacting EOC.  Need dedicated communication tie between affected jurisdictions, EOC, 911 center and Mobile Command Vehicle (CV 1). 

Action:

Identify an unpublished line or set frequency to facilitate better communications and incorporate process into EOC checklist.

Comment:

Difficulty accessing second floor in the Public Safety Building after hours. 

Action:

Work with Facilities Management, Sheriff™s Office Central Control to develop a method to access elevators after hours.

Comment:

Internal EOC contact sheets worked well. Would like to see this information placed on the intranet.

Action:

Place ﬁInternal Contact Formﬂ template on Dcinet.

Comment:

Difficulty encountered communicating with chief elected officials effectively early on due to lack of after hour telephone numbers. 

Action:

Work with the 911 center to update municipal information and establish protocol for notification.  Incorporate a process to keep information current.

Comment: Local jurisdictions may want to incorporate the use of amateur radio into their plans. This would support communications when other methods have been rendered inoperable.

Comment:

Consider the use of ﬁCell on Wheelsﬂ.  This should be considered to assist with the rebuilding of a damaged or destroyed cellular infrastructure.

Fire Response:

Comment:

Encountered difficulty in ascertaining the size of the effected area. 

The loss of phone lines and diminished capacity of the cell tower that was due to upgrade and repairs created communication difficulties.  Additional maps of affected areas would have been helpful.  Explore countywide pager code for Fire/EMS departments.  Need maps of all towns, villages and cities in CV-1. 

Action:

County, city, village and towns maps to be placed in CV-1. A meeting has been set with all participating fire departments to facilitate additional discussions and lessons learned.  Issues identified from this meeting will be included in this document. 

Action Step Achieved Comment:

Should have sent first response units to where storm started and worked east from there. 

Action:

Discus options for identifying magnitude of event and strategy for response.  Time permitting; develop an ﬁIncident Action Planﬂ early into event.   U:\ems\SHARED\After Action Report-Stoughton Tornado.doc Last printed 2/14/2006 9:24 AM 5Comment:

Command staff should have been more clearly identified and rotated into work shifts. 

Action:

Provide additional training in ICS and Unified Command. 

Comment:

CV-1 needed to be staffed by senior command staff only.  Many people inside with no apparent function. 

Action:

Use the Liaison Officer (Command Staff) to oversee Command Structure in CV-1.  Educate personnel on procedure.

Comment: Some units felt they were on their own during the initial response. 

Did not know CV-1 was on location. 

Action:

Additional training needed. 

Communications plan and command structure should be identified to all incoming units. 

Utilization of staging should be maximized for coordination.

Comment:

Everyone was asking the 911 center for resources.  Reports of trees down and wires down were over whelming the 911 center. 

Action:

The EOC can take calls for additional resources, although all requests for personnel must be coordinated through the 911 center.  Discuss how this coordination could be enhanced with the 911 center, incident command and Emergency Management.

Comment:

Argument grew between fire and law enforcement on where CV-1 should be placed. 

Action:

Additional education and clarity is needed on command vehicle use and placement.  Educate responders on primary use of command vehicle. 

Additional training and exercising required countywide.

Comment:

Headsets in CV-1 were a problem.  Noise was also a problem from the on board generator. 

Action:

Remount generator with additional stabilization.  Mobile command committee to investigate headset concerns and make recommendations for improvement. 

Action Step Achieved.

Comment:

Scene was not sectored off early on.  Responding crews self-assigned. 

Action:

Conduct addition training on ICS and command structure.  All incoming units should report by radio to command for assignments until staging area is identified.  Once staging area is identified, all reporting units would report there for assignments. 

Comment:

Fire needs a better understand of the role of the EOC. 

Action:

Emergency Management to offer education on EOC function.

Comment:

More people from DCFCA need to be training on EOC duties. 

Action:

Provide a training session for DCFCA on EOC operations.

Comment:

Incident magnitude overwhelming, need to break down incident for response and recovery. 

Action:

Additional education needed on ICS and unified command.  Provide training on NIMS.  U:\ems\SHARED\After Action Report-Stoughton Tornado.doc Last printed 2/14/2006 9:24 AM 6 Comment:

Residents wanted to burn.  This could have been a problem early on. 

Action:

Work with the jurisdictional fire department on burning ban and coordinate with local and state agencies.

Comment:

Fire was searching building only to have law enforcement come along and search the same buildings and vice versa. 

Action:

Develop an action plan and identify roles and responsibly.  Communicate plan out into the field.

Comment:

Need a standard method of marking dwelling once they have been searched. 

Action:

Work cooperatively with fire, law enforcement and public works to develop a uniform method of identification.

EMS Field Response Comment:

Confusion as to what channels were to be used and triage system for calls. 

Action:

Set up meeting with 911 center to review protocol and discuss concerns with providers.

Law Enforcement Field Response Comment:

Need for a formal process to establish command (ICS).  Need for external generator for CVI.  Noise levels too high. Discuss placement of CVI and how conflict in placement can be elevated.

There were numerous access and re-entry issues. 911 Center ability to communicate with Stoughton law enforcement was shared. 

Action:

The 911 center will work with Stoughton police department to re-establish that communication link.

Mobile Command Vehicle Comment:

The unit was requested early on in the event and was dispatched to the affected area. Issues of placement, communication integration and command structure, and access were identified. Due to noise concerns it was determined that an external generator is required for long-term incidents. There is also a need for porta- potties.  Although the unit has an interior lavatory, high useable make additional external facilities necessary.  Additional maps are needed.  Also the designation of a dedicated line for communication with the EOC needs to be identified. 

Action: A checklist will be developed that addresses long-term usage issues with support contact information.  This information will be posted in the command vehicle.  Maps are being produces and will be labeled and placed in the map storage area.  An incident command organization flow chart will be developed and placed in the operations area. 

Action Step Achieved.

Hospitals Comment:

The Stoughton Hospital had several issues surrounding internal and external communications.  Notification was an issue. 

Action:

Work with Interhospital Communications and Disaster Committee to address communications and notification issues.  Establish a link for notification.   U:\ems\SHARED\After Action Report-Stoughton Tornado.doc Last printed 2/14/2006 9:24 AM 7 Comment:

The first ambulance arrived without any prior notification to the hospital.  There were some EMS support units that did not have capability to radio the hospital.  The interaction between the hospital and the County EOC through the medical support function worked very well. Requests from the Stoughton Hospital for additional medical personnel were handled effectively.  Security at the hospital was a concern. 

External communication with field command, CVI and others needs to be coordinated. 

Action:

Facilitate a debriefing meeting with Stoughton Hospital, responding EMS agencies, Incident command, 911, Sheriff™s Office, and Dane County Emergency Management. 

Action Step Achieved.

Public Information/Communications Comment:

Dissemination of information to residents in affected areas could have been coordinated more effectively. 

Action:

In the future use the media more effectively to reach affected residents. This may be restricted if people are displaced or do not have access to television or radio.  Use American Red Cross (shelter locations) and Salvation Army (mobile feeding and fixed feeding sites) to reach out to affected residents.  Also suggested was that central points within the affected area be established for information dissemination.

Comment:

Meetings with affected jurisdictions was appreciated and effective but need to be a brief and to the point.  The meeting conducted with affected residents was beneficial and should be considered in the future.

Damage Assessment Comment:

Damage assessment for the most part went very well.  Some areas were difficult to access.  Other agencies engage in damage assessment, i.e. American Red Cross. The EOC made a request to the Civil Air Patrol to fly a mission of the affected area.  The video was reviewed in the EOC. 

Action:

Incorporate a process in which all damage assessment information is collected in a coordinated fashion and shared.

Resource Support Comment:

Consensus was that resource allocation, support and response was excellent. The EOC supported requests affectively.  State and local resources were utilized.  Rock and Green Counties provided additional emergency lighting.

Pass System/Perimeter Control Comment:

There was agreement that a pass system for perimeter control was needed.  There were simply too many colors.  Those individuals identified by uniform, credentials should be allowed into the affected area.  Township personnel responding with township equipment should also be allowed into affected areas without accessing a pass. 

Action:

A meeting will be called by Dane County Emergency Management to include affected jurisdictions, sheriff™s office, and City of Stoughton personnel involved in the issuance of the system to discuss how the system could be improved. 

Action Step Achieved.  U:\ems\SHARED\After Action Report-Stoughton Tornado.doc Last printed 2/14/2006 9:24 AM 8 Comment:

Citizens in private cars were a problem for responding units. 

Action:

Use command structure to inform law enforcement of the condition.  Request assistance on perimeter control.

Volunteer Coordination The EOC requested the support of the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to dispatch their incident action team to support volunteer coordination.  The EOC provided logistical support.  The DNR used aerial photography to map out their incident action plan. 

Comment:

The consensus was that this was conducted in an ﬁExcellentﬂ manner.

Debris Management and Removal Comment:

The Public Works, Highway and Transportation Department were praised for their fine work with debris management. In the future they would have personnel into the field sooner for assessment of need.  Use of ﬁClamsﬂ from the City of Madison was extremely helpful.  Coordination and communication with townships on debris removal issues need to be addressed. 

Action:

Public Works, Hwy and Transportation to coordinate a meeting with affected townships to discuss how these areas could be improved.

Public Health The Dane County Division of Public Health coordinated and facilitated tetanus immunization to residents, first responders and volunteers.  Due to the significant debris encountered in response and cleanup activities this vital resource was extremely beneficial.  The Division coordinated these efforts with the Department of Natural Resources (coordinating volunteer efforts) and with responding and affected jurisdictions. 

Action: This imitative should always be considered when responding to such an event.

Shelter and Feeding The American Red Cross is charged with the planning, resources, and response to a request for shelter support in a disaster.  They have signed agreements with facilities. 

They also have cots, blankets, and trained personnel available in support of establishing a shelter. The American Red Cross provides feeding in the shelters and mobile canteen services in the field.  The Salvation Army provided hot meals in the field and also provided meals to the EOC staff. All requests for shelters, feeding, and support services were coordinated within the EOC. 

Comment:

Excellent response from the American Red Cross and Salvation Army.  Local church groups were also praised for their support.

Long Term Recovery Comment:

Establish place and telephone number for monetary donations earlier.

Mental Health Comment:

Provision for mental health was supported by the American Red Cross and Dane County Volunteer Mental Health Response Team (MHRT).  By the end of the response more than 25 MHRT members had served in the Stoughton area or had played U:\ems\SHARED\After Action Report-Stoughton Tornado.doc Last printed 2/14/2006 9:24 AM 9critical roles.  Feedback received was that wonderful work was done and that both tornado survivors and mental health providers had been touched by their experiences.

These issues were identified during the Mental Health Response Team debriefing on September 23, 2005. The overall feeling by MHRT members performed a vital task and did make a difference to storm victims.  There is an obvious need for these services.  This was the first time that MHRT members had actually responded to an incident.

Comment:

The MHRT call list needs to be updated.  Also additional information concerning the members and their availability would be extremely helpful for those that are conducting notification. 

Action:

Update existing contact information biannually. 

Add additional information as identified.

Comment:

The use of a ﬁphone treeﬂ proved to be a cumbersome task. The activation of the MHRT needs to be more organized. 

Action: Review activation process, i.e. when persons are activated, where they can secure supplies, where they are to be staged, where and how they will access the scene and more information on what the scene entails.

Comment:

Access to MHRT supplies was an issue. 

Action:

Store supplies in new visibly marked boxes at a common location accessible to the whole team. 

Incorporate some sort of highly visible identification for team members.

Communications Comment:

Everyone wanted to talk to command at once. 

Action:

Identify clear communication structure and plan for incident.  Educate responders to process and conduct exercise to emphasis need.

Other Comments Access Volunteer Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD) and incorporate into EOC activities and field response when appropriate.  Faith based groups were extremely helpful.  Continue to press media to publicize the enormous impact on the affected communities. Emphasis issues of long-term recovery and economic loss.  Concern was voiced about the number of helicopters flying in the affected area.  Information was shared on how air space could be shut down if requested and appropriate.             U:\ems\SHARED\After Action Report-Stoughton Tornado.doc Last printed 2/14/2006 9:24 AM 10The subsequent is provided as ﬁLessons Learnedﬂ.  v Initially we may not know the extent of the area that has been affected.   v A system of tracking displaced persons is needed. v An electronic system of tracking donated goods, services, and contributions is needed.  v Set up a process for receiving financial contributions earlier. v There is a need for a formal Long Term Recovery Plan. v Additional training is required on the Incident Command System v We need to have 24-hour contact information for local elected officials. v Additional training is required with all personnel on the role of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  v There is a need to create maps of town, cities and villages to be transported in the mobile command center.   v Access to the scene was difficult to control. v

The pass system worked well but required modification.
