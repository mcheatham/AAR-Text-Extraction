A total of 125 Situation Reports (SITREP) and 5 Spot Reports (SPOTREP) were issued. 

A Declaration of Emergency was made by the Omaha District on 8 January 2010. The declaration was based on the ice conditions and potential spring floods. This potential for flooding was due to the above normal snowpack over most of the upper Missouri River basin. 

A request for technical assistance was received from the State of Nebraska on 7 January 2010 for assessment and monitoring of current ice jams, and flood planning. 

The following is an outline of subsequent events:  29 Jan Ð NWS first flood outlook issued Significant snowpack on the plains existed, high potential for flooding/ice jams. 2 Feb Ð NWO ND , SD and eastern NE are covered by 2 to 4Ó of SWE.

Orrick, Missouri 64077 Waters4@ix.netcom.com  (816) 770-5562 Home/Office   (816) 591-7949  Cell  ¥ After Action Review should be re-titled, ÒMidÓ Action Review The flood event is not ÒoverÓ until the levees have been repaired and flood protection has been restored.  The River remains at or above flood stage at many locations and a large rain event could very quickly have us once again back into an emergency situation.  The flood fighting effort was a great help to levee sponsors and communities in harms way, but levee sponsors really need the Corps of Engineers to step up and commit to a rapid rehabilitation and repair effort in order to get flood protection restored as soon as possible.  The level of importance should remain high on the Corps of Engineers priority list until recovery and rehabilitation has been completed and the flood event is truly over.  ¥ Levee Districts and Sponsors are pleased and grateful for the Corps of EngineerÕs efforts during the recent high water event.

For the most part people along the River understood the lower reservoirs were at critically high levels and pleased the Corps of Engineers was able to manage the system to prevent as much damage as they did.  Most expected more damages than occurred and recognize the good job the water management folks did to manage the full reservoirs and heavy rainfall.  ¥ Questions regarding the management of the system prior to the heavy inflows in the early spring and winter months.

There have been many questions surrounding how the upper reservoirs were managed earlier in the year.  Some of these questions include the following:  Was too much water moved from the upper reservoirs into the lower reservoirs before the heavy rainfall and runoff into the lower reservoirs?  Could more water have been kept in the upper reservoirs and would that have helped to keep the lower reservoirs from getting so full?  Was the Master Manual followed? The management of the water between the reservoirs may be a valid issue to include in the Missouri River Authorized Purposes Study.   ¥ Frustration with Missouri River Gauge Information There seems to be a great deal of frustration with the information provided by the National Weather Service.  River level predictions were often forecasted well above what actually occurred and information from some locations was hard to find or not provided in a timely manner.  Levee Districts and sponsors rely on gauge information to plan and implement flood-fighting efforts.  More timely and accurate information would be very helpful to all of us.  There may be a need for 1) more gauges along the river, 2) updated gauges and 3) better means of converting the gauge reading to more reliable information provided to the public in a timelier manner.  (cont)     2010 NWD Missouri Basin Regional AAR  #AA-/=1G&$&&    21 Missouri Levee & Drainage District Association (MLDDA) Tom Waters, Chairman (cont)  ¥ Daily Conference Calls and Updates were very helpful

We appreciate the opportunity to participate in the daily conference calls.  We were able to keep our members and others informed and relay important information to them.  We would have liked for the Omaha District to continue to participate with the Kansas City District on the calls.  (The first one or two calls had personnel from both Districts)  It is helpful for those of us below the Omaha District to also know what is happening upstream. (Over-toppings, breaches and other damage occurring)     ¥ Field Visits and Briefings We appreciate Colonel Wilson and General McMahon visiting impacted areas during the flood fighting efforts.  Their effort to gain information from the sponsors and local people on the ground was helpful and allowed an open dialogue with stakeholders.  We would like to see these visits continue in the future as well as opportunities for members of the water management team in Omaha to experience the flood-fighting efforts and see the impact of the flooding on communities as it occurs. 

It is important to us for all those making decisions regarding the management of the reservoir system to have a first-hand understanding of the impact of flooding on businesses, communities and property.    ¥ Moving Forward We are very concerned with the time it takes to get the levees repaired and restore flood protection.  Recovery from this event will again be slow due to the continued high water being released from the reservoir system.  We expect the River to be high through the end of the year.  Drainage ditches are still full and will remain full until the river falls and allows the gravity flow structures to open and drain.  We are very concerned with the high levels of water being held within our internal drainage systems. 

Fall rains could have huge negative impacts on the agricultural harvest throughout the Missouri River bottoms due to the lack of drainage the overfull system can provide.  ¥

Off Topic Comments In addition to the slow repair and rehabilitation process, we have concerns with the Levee Inspection Program, the FEMA Levee Certification Program, and especially the direction the National Committee on Levee Safety is taking.  Each of these programs, while not all in the Corps of Engineers area of responsibility, have the potential to bring hardship and heavy burdens to levee districts and levee sponsors.  It is very likely the results of these programs will be to force levees out of the Corps of EngineersÕ program and in turn reduce the safety and reliability of the overall flood control system nationwide.  ¥  Thank You Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the review of the flood event.  I appreciate the opportunity to provide comments and welcome the opportunity to continue to improve our flood control efforts.  2010 NWD Missouri Basin Regional AAR  #AA-/=1G&$&&    22 Missouri-Arkansas River Basin Association (MO-ARK) Ron Blakley, President 816.262.5845

The following are comments I would like to discuss in the AAR meeting. 

I want to thank BG McMahon for the opportunity to take part in the After Action Review meeting. I hope my comments will be of value to the participants. Due to time restraints, I will do my best not to duplicate what my friend Tom Waters has submitted. I want to emphasize that our risk assessment and action plan prior to the flood kept our levees from overtopping, prevented loss of life and held property damage to a minimum. Each of our efforts played an important role and enabled our flood fight to be successful. The following are some of the key flood protection and damage reduction actions we took. 

The Buchanan County Emergency Management Director was designated as the Incident Commander to work with various agencies and to coordinate supplies to the work sites. There was value in having one contact person in charge who was also responsible for equipment and supplies. This reduced confusion, enhanced communication and helped prevent delays. 

Region H Hazmat provided two four wheel drive ATV vehicles to transport sandbags to the boats waiting at the river. More of these vehicles would have been beneficial to carry sandbags to the levee. I would like the Corps to consider having some of these available for levy sponsors. 

The Buchanan County Sheriff's Department was contacted to provide security and traffic control. 

Safety and security of the levee system was prioritized and one of the first actions we took. 

Local volunteers provided manpower for filling sandbags, provided trucks, tractors, loaders and an airplane to fly the levee system to look for trouble spots. The Missouri Department of Corrections provided 22 offenders with correctional staff to assist with sandbagging. The Western Regional Diagnostic Center provided 44 offenders to assist with sandbagging. Halls Levee District Board members who have been trained in proper flood fighting techniques by the Corps supervised the sandbaggers. 

The sandbagging machine and operator provided by the Corps was invaluable. The machine made the sandbagging operation much more efficient and I would recommend the Corps purchase more of them for future use.  I also intend to talk to the Governor to explore the possibility of making trustees in the prison system available to flood fight in the future. 

The most significant issue we faced in the sandbagging operation was the amount of inconsistent information from NWS. I would strongly recommend the Corps switch to using USGS information only.  The NWS information was as much as four hours behind what the actual river stage was. The USGS information was timely.

I am concerned with the direction the levee safety committee is taking. Tom Waters and I were directly involved in the LLS levee re-hab program where the need for such a committee was first discussed and endorsed. The purpose of the committee was to evaluate the condition of our aging levee systems and report their findings. That information together with the current work of the LSS levee re-hab committee would then be the basis for a leaner, more efficient flood control program.  (cont) 2010 NWD Missouri Basin Regional AAR  #AA-/=1G&$&&    23 Missouri-Arkansas River Basin Association (MO-ARK) Ron Blakley, President (cont)

I understand the NLSC is recommending the formulation of a National Levee Safety Program, which I oppose. My opposition to the program is based on the premise that it only takes into consideration protection provided by the levee. I would support an alternative plan where recommendations would be taken from all stakeholders and a National Levee Risk Management Program (NLRMP) be established. If we look at the problems created by flooding, much more is involved than building bigger, stronger levees. A good plan needs to include education in flood fighting techniques, address security issues, how to provide transportation of victims and supplies, create methods to enhance communication, who will provide medical aid and much more. The NLSC  program relies on protection only to lessen flooding risk. The NLRMP provides flood protection, saves lives and reduces property damage at a lesser cost.

Thank you, and I look forward to the meeting.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   2010 NWD Missouri Basin Regional AAR  #AA-/=1G&$&&    24 After Action Review Ð Missouri River Basin Flooding and Flood Fight Northwestern Division August 31, 2010 (updated 9-1-2010) By David L. Pope, Executive Director Missouri River Association of States and Tribes Summary comments 1.Thanks for the opportunity to participate as a stakeholder in the After Action Review. 

Our comments will primarily be from the perspective of the state water or natural resources agencies responsible for water management in their states.  Generally, this includes agencies with responsibility for floodplain management and often regulatory programs related to levees, floodplain fills and/or stream obstructions along with the safety of non-federal dams.  Emergency response is typically handled by State Departments of Emergency Management, although there is typically coordination and with the water agencies who provide technical assistance as needed.   2.With regard to flood experiences in 2010, my consultations have revealed feedback that is quite positive regarding the activities of the USACE, including assistance with flood fight activities as well as operation of the Missouri River Reservoir Mainstem Reservoir system.       3.Feedback indicated appreciation for the USACEÕs challenge to operate the mainstem reservoir system during periods of high runoff above and below some of the reservoirs. 

There is a recognized need to balance flood protection below reservoirs with impacts to the impounded areas, as well as to protect the reservoirs themselves from failure. 

Consultation with states and others is helpful, as are the periodic reports and news releases.  We have not conducted a detail evaluation of all the potential Òwhat ifÓ scenarios or things that could have been done differently, on an after-the-fact basis.     4.My contacts were appreciative of the series of coordination conference calls that occurred to share information when river systems or tributaries were flooding or expected to do so.   5.Coordination meetings with state, local and community leaders were very helpful in preparation for potential flooding through early interaction.  When requested by communities, emergency technical support, such as guidance and flood preparation through emergency advance measures (such as emergency levees, etc.), was very helpful.   6.I received positive feedback on the use of the Silver Jackets program to work with the Corps and other agencies on preventive measures and long term flood solutions.  Some communities are pursuing potential flood preventive measures through Corps authorities, such as Sec. 22, etc. 7.Feedback indicates a need for the Corps to more closely coordinate with state regulatory agencies regarding potential emergency actions that may involve levees, floodplain fills and/or stream obstructions.  While a local government entity may request assistance with the construction of such a project, others may be concerned about other impacts.  Several States (and potentially Tribes) are required to review and evaluate potential impacts to protect all interests in accordance with State law.  Close coordination with these entities would avoid the construction of unacceptable or potentially unlawful projects.  2010 NWD Missouri Basin Regional AAR  #AA-/=1G&$&&    25 Doug Hofer: Director of South Dakota State Parks and Recreation Below is a short summary of the comments that I will make today during the conference call. 

Impacts of Flood on SD State Park Areas Lake Francis Case Pool elevations on LFC impacted numerous state park boat ramps during the busiest fishing time of the year (mid-June to mid-July).  Seven of eighteen ramps were closed and the docks were pulled on another six. 

All boats had to be removed from marina slips at Snake Creek and North Point Recreation Areas and either put on trailer or connected to a mooring anchor.  Electrical and water service to the marina dock systems had to be disconnected.  Above-ground fuel tanks and pumps had to be disconnected and removed.  All of these issues resulted in lost income for the concessionaire. 

At Snake Creek and Platte Creek Recreation Areas 12 campsites were lost for a period of three weeks.  Most of the 111 campsites at North Point Recreation Area were unusable over a three week period including the 4th of July and none of the sites had electricity or use of comfort stations over the holiday weekend.  The park staff responded by building a temporary 75-unit campground on high ground.  Without electricity or showers, the temporary campground did not attract many users; but the Pickstown business community was very appreciative of the StateÕs efforts to keep tourism alive in the area over the important summer holiday. Through July, we are down 2,463 camping units (46%) from the same period last year at North Point. 

A 50-man DOC inmate crew spent time cleaning up flood debris at North Point.  Additional cleanup and repair was accomplished by park staff as the water receded.  We are projecting that the total cost in contractual services and materials to repair damage at North Point alone will be $80,000.00 - $100,000.00. 

Lewis & Clark Lake The hard surfaced bike trail at Lewis and Clark Recreation Area suffered erosion damage due to the high pool elevation.  Some limited shoreline erosion occurred although most of the damage was mitigated by shoreline protection accomplished over the past two decades.  The fluctuating water level over much of June and July required constant adjustment of docks on the lakes boat ramps.

Thoughts on Lake Francis Case and Lewis and Clark Lake water level management during summer 2010

LAKE FRANCIS CASE Some of the flooding could have been alleviated early on by releasing water sooner in the spring. 

Allowing LFC to run at a higher than normal pool earlier in the season took away flexibility to control the water level when the wet cycle started.  A significant amount of public service and facilities go out of service and are damaged at water levels exceeding 1,362 feet.  (cont) 2010 NWD Missouri Basin Regional AAR  #AA-/=1G&$&&    26 Doug Hofer: Director of South Dakota State Parks and Recreation Cont LEWIS & CLARK LAKE A summer operating pool level of 1206.5 rather than 1206.0 is optimal for SD state park facilities on Lewis and Clark Lake.  When it dips below the level of 1206.0 it essential takes 3 boat ramps (2 @ L&C and 1 @ Springfield) out of commission for normal size watercraft (17' boats or more). We understand that when big water/rain events take place (which is typically a handful of times each summer) that it is necessary to flex the pool level up and down.  However, it is the rest of the operating season (which is 90% + of the time) that excess fluctuation can greatly effect our facilities. A 1206.5 normal summer pool elevation would provide a cushion that would make it easier to keep the pool above the critical 1206.0 elevation. 

Forecasting We spent the spring bracing for predicted high pools that never materialized.  In June and July we were reacting to high pool levels that were not predicted.  It would have been helpful to have more frequent updates to the three week forecast.    2010 NWD Missouri Basin Regional AAR  #AA-/=1G&$&&    27 Corps After Action Review Conference Call Comments Submitted by:  Dan Engemann, Deputy District Director,

Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer (MO-09) 8/31/10

Thank you for the opportunity to participate.  Thanks as well for the daily conference calls during the flood event.  These were very helpful.  I also appreciate the flyover you hosted for the Missouri Congressional delegation. 

I appreciate the actions of Gen. McMahon to halt releases from Gavins Point Dam for a brief period around FatherÕs Day.  And I appreciate the actions taken to close off tributary reservoirs to keep the situation on the lower Missouri from being much worse. 

I canÕt stress enough the need for communication during these events.  I would like to see greater communication regarding the releases coming from both the mainstem and tributary reservoirs. 

I get most of my calls from Hermann, which is affected by releases from both the mainstem and Truman & Bagnell reservoirs.  I would like to see a system established to where landowners could have direct contact with Truman Reservoir to determine whatÕs headed their way.

I donÕt think the Corps knows exactly how these releases affect downstream interests.  In late May, an extra 2-3 feet of water was added at the Hermann gauge due to these releases from Truman, and I question the necessity of that. 

IÕve had discussions with the Kansas City Dist. Staff and former Col. Wilson about the need to model communications after the St. Louis District.  They have developed a great dialogue and working relationship with the farmers in the lower Salt River Basin in regard to releases coming from Mark Twain Lake & Clarence Cannon Dam.

A couple of farmers there serve as Òpoint peopleÓ for the downstream interests there, and have cell phone numbers for decision makers at Mark Twain Lake.  During high water events, they are on the phone daily, if not more, explaining to Corps staff what the situation is like below the dam.  Again, I would like to see a similar process established here.

Many questions remain about the Corps management of the mainstem reservoirs earlier in the year.  Is there anything that couldÕve been handled differently to keep them from getting so full?
